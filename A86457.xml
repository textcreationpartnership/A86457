      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This book is a Propheſie (as Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it out of Mr <hi>Mede</hi>) of the deſtruction of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire, either as heatheniſh in the whole, or elſe Chriſtian (yet perſecuting) in both the parts of it, Eaſt and Weſt: The Book is tragi-comedy, which begins with a kingdom given to be won by conqueſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.—
<pb facs="tcp:165674:6"/>and ends with the Coronation of a King, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his Bride: and all between is but the removing of all ſuch lets and impediments, namely, of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Monarchy, and all other kingdomes which that was broken into, ſo far as they ſtand in the way, and poſſeſſe the roome of that kingdome which is to beſet up. When Chriſt firſt began (the whole world then worſhipping Idols) he ſets upon conquering the whole Romane Empire, as it was heatheniſh, and the worſhip of Satan and Idols in it, and in three hundred yeares he diſpatcheth that, and throws down all both Idoll wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Princes that did uphold it; And then when the whole Empire was turned Chriſtian, yet the devill (as one ewll ſaid) did not turne Chriſtian: but under the name and profeſſion of Chriſt he ſtirreth up the Arrian Chriſtian world to proſecute the Orthodox Chriſtians as much as heatheniſh <hi>Rome</hi> had done; but Chriſt takes further vengeance for this perſecution under both theſe, Heatheniſh and Arrian <hi>Rome</hi> (it was the cry of the bloud of the Saints — ſlaine under both that brought on them the vengeance that followed, ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10.11.) The Empire having been afore divided into two parts; the Eaſterne (all which now the Turk poſſeſſeth) and the Weſterne; this in Europe: he fals firſt on the Weſterne Europian part, breaking that by the incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe barbarous nations<note n="*" place="margin">Which the foure firſt Trumpets did ſound forth, as M. <hi>Goodwyn</hi> affirms, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.</note> the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals;</hi> then for the Eaſterne part of the Empire (although his revenge was ſlower, yet) he reſerved them for the foreſt vengeance that could befall the Chriſtian world, the Conqueſt and Tyranny of the<note n="*" place="margin">The 6. Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſounded forth this, <hi>ch.</hi> 9.13.</note> 
               <hi>Saracens</hi> firſt, afterwards the Turks; Thus here is an end of the Romane Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy under the Emperours in the whole, and in the
<pb facs="tcp:165674:7"/>parts of it. The Weſterne part in Europe was by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Goths</hi> invaſion broken into ſeven Kingdoms, which though helping the Woman againſt the floud of Arrian perſecution, yet (through Satans ſeducing of them) they ſet up the Beaſt or Antichriſtian <hi>Rome.</hi> And theſe altogether did joine to make us as great a war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Saints in <hi>Ch.</hi> 13. as the Heathens and Arrians had done; and ſo Chriſt in a manner was as far off his Kingdome as at firſt. The next counterplot of Jeſus Chriſt is to overcome theſe Kingdomes; ſo you find <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14. <hi>They ſhall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb ſhall overcome them; for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, and they that are with him are called choſen and faithful.</hi> Thus far he.</p>
            <p>Which generall methodicall diviſion I in the general like and allow of, though in particular I have ſhewed upon <hi>Chapter</hi> eight, that the firſt foure Trumpets did not ſignifie the incurſion of thoſe Nations, <hi>Goths,</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi> neither indeed came they to help the Woman, but to deſtroy her, though they embraced her faith when moſt corrupted, of which more in order and place. See <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. I deſire the Reader to remember that though the Revelation may ſeeme to be one continued Viſion, yet indeed it is not one, nor revealed at one time, but ſeven, as ſo many ſights exhibited to <hi>John</hi> in the Spirit. <hi>John</hi> was not once only, but oft times raviſhed in the Spirit, neither ſaw he all in one place, but ſome things in <hi>Patmos,</hi> ſome things in heaven, ſome things at the ſeaſhore, ſome things in the Wilderneſſe. Note the Revelation (ſayes <hi>Pareus</hi> out of <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) ſpeakes the ſame things after a diverſe manner; the former Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are for the moſt part more obſcure, the latter bring
<pb facs="tcp:165674:7"/>clearer light to the darkneſſe of the former, if one right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve them, (ſayes <hi>Pareus;</hi>) for example in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Viſion, the <hi>black horſe</hi> denotes the Church made black with hereſies after <hi>Constantines</hi> time: the <hi>pale horſe</hi> having death ſitting on, and drawing hell after him, the Church ſick even unto death towards Antichriſts riſing: In the third Viſion by the ſounding of the third, fourth, and fifth Trumpets, the ſame ſtate of the Church is indeed repreſented: yet more eſpecially the declining, corruption, and laſtly, the Apoſtacy of the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> — plainer. Some Viſions repreſent the foure conditions, or the foure acts of the Church, to wit, of its flouriſhing and groaning under Roman Tyrants till peace brought in by <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> 2. Of the Church raigning and rioting under Chriſtian Emperours till the riſing of the Weſterne Antichriſt, <hi>Boniface</hi> third Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Eaſterne in <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſix yeares after. 3. Of the Church trodden upon, and oppreſſed by Antichriſt, eſpecially the Weſterne, till the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of the Temple, which began to be effected by the Two witneſſes <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> who were ſlain by the Beaſt in the Councel of <hi>Conſtance, Anno</hi> 1414. and thence untill <hi>Luther,</hi> by whoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry the meaſuring of the Temple (hindered through the tyranny of Popes) began to be continued, <hi>Anno</hi> 1517. The fourth of the Church reformed from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and of the declining of Papacy, to endure till the end; Some Viſions repreſent not the entire, but only the two<note n="*" place="margin">The 2, 3, 4, and 7. Viſions containe the 4. Acts or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the Church: the 5. and 6. Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are more particular: containing the 7. laſt plagues, and the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Whore.</note> latter conditions of the Church: Thus the moſt excellent <hi>Pareus.</hi> It is ſafeſt expounding the Revelation by the Revelation, one thing explaining another: yet much of this Book the Lord hath yet
<pb facs="tcp:165674:8"/>reſerved in his own power (yet this latter age hath had better help of experience then that of the Fathers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things being fulfilled, which they dived not into.) The fourth Actor condition of the Church with its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment is ſecret: Becauſe the ſeventh Trumpet hath not yet ſounded: Neither is the ſeventh Viall yet poured out into the aire; a great part alſo of the third Act is reſerved unto poſterity which in time ſhall ſee the gathering together the Kings of the earth into <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageddon,</hi> the burning of the whoriſh woman, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the event of the Goggiſh war— More then the beginning we have ſeen, and further ſhall ſee.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Word <hi>Revelation</hi> or <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> ſignifies the unfolding of a ſecret. Tis called a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for two reaſons. Firſt, becauſe we need the knowledge of it. Secondly it ſhews the divine authority of it; for the title anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the title of the ancient Prophets; as the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſo the Revelation of <hi>John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of Jeſus Chriſt which God gave him]</hi> God may be ſaid to give it to Chriſt, as he was man; nay (as God) for the father
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:165674:9"/>is the fountaine of the Godhead. So Chriſts wiſedome is from the father by an eternal generation; it ſhews Chriſt to be God, becauſe it belongs to God only to reveal ſecrets. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.23. now tis Chriſt office to reveal to his People the Will of his father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His ſervants]</hi> To wit. Chriſt. This proves Chriſts divine nature, becauſe all the faithfull are his ſervants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which muſt ſhortly come to paſſe]</hi> therefore this book doth not treat of things then paſt (as ſome would perſwade) but things to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Muſt come]</hi> ſhews the unchangeable decree of God. Alſo ſecondary cauſes, (as the malice and rage of Satan and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments againſt the Church, (though unchangeable cauſes) if not hindred by the over-ruling Power of God) bring forth neceſſarily an effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shortly]</hi> That is, ſhall begin ſuddainly to take effect, though the things herein mentioned were not in a very ſhort time to be all performed: for many hundred years are paſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and yet many things are not come to paſſe; yet the time is ſhort in reſpect of the age of the world already paſt, or in reſpect of eternity,<note place="margin">Alcazar.</note> or God, with whom a thouſand years are but as one day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſignified it by his Angel]</hi> God gave him the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to keep for himſelf, but to ſhew it to his ſervants; now is expreſſed the faithfulneſſe of Chriſt in executing his charge committed to him of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he ſent]</hi> This proves Chriſts Divinity in that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Angels, and they obey him. This is <hi>Pauls</hi> argument of the Deity of the Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His ſervant John]</hi> Chriſt takes notice of, nay doth regiſter the names of his ſervants. Poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> is mentioned, when the rich mans name is buried in Oblivion; only <hi>there was a certain rich man.</hi> Happy are his ſervants whom he hath graven (unto their comfort be it ſpoken) on the palmes of his hands, not on iron but fleſh, not on his back parts, but his hands, not the back of them, but the palmes of his hands.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Who bare record of the Word of God]</hi> That is, of

                  <p>
                     <hi>Of this Prophecie]</hi> This ſhews it is from God, for all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie is of him, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. it may alſo the ſooner ſtirre up our hearts to feek the knowledge of this book: for men do covet to know the things to come.

                  <p>
                     <hi>From the ſeven Spirits before the throne]</hi> the holy Spirit is called <hi>ſeven</hi> becauſe he is perfect in working; for <hi>ſeven</hi> is uſed for a perfect number in this book.

Alſo <hi>Pareus</hi> agrees with me, that in <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. created angels may be underſtood, but not here.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And from Ieſus Chriſt]</hi> Peace cometh by Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.15. Chriſt here is treated of as the Mediatour, and therefore is put laſt; the order is ſometimes in the Scripture o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi>

                     <hi>Out of his place, except thou repent]</hi> Notes the manner of this Churches deſtruction, not (but that each member upon repentance might be ſaved) for 'twas deſtroyed and viſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by a barbarous nation afterward upon her impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and ſecurity. This teaches, that the abode of the Church in this world is uncertaine; we (nor the Church) have in this world any continuing place.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>But this thou haſt, that thou hateſt, &amp;c.]</hi> This ſhewes he was not in a deſperate condition; you ſee the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel had vertues which the Lord takes notice of, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The deeds of the Nicholaitans]</hi> Thier hereſie was that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and eating things offered to Idols was no ſin, which alſo was that curſed doctrine of <hi>Balaam.</hi> See <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. compared with <hi>chap.</hi> 31. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8.16.—This hereſie was not as as ſome ſuppoſe, taught by <hi>Nicholas</hi> one of the 7.

                     <hi>Nicholas;</hi> or fathered upon him by the upholders of this hereſie, as a cloak for their wickedneſſe: We all hold the doctrine of Chriſt, and are called by his name, and not after the name of any other teacher.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear]</hi> This is to ſtir up attention to obſerve the things formerly written to the teacher of the Church of <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What the Spirit ſaith to the Churches]</hi> Becauſe Chriſt ſpeaks by the ſpirit, as proceeding from him; which proves Chriſts deity to the Churches. The things you ſee concerne the Churches and not the Paſtour alone; and indeed tis uſually, like Prieſt, like people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To him that overcometh will I give,</hi> &amp;c.] He is ſaid to overcome, who manfully to the end fights againſt the world, fleſh and devil. Here is nothing promiſed to fallers away. Chriſt promiſes a reward to thoſe that overcome (though with his own power.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To eat of the tree of life</hi> &amp;c.] Alluding to the tree which ſtood in the midſt of Paradiſe, ſo called afterward: becauſe had our firſt Parents eaten of it once, they had lived; or becauſe it ſignified Chriſt who is the truth and the life. So 'tis but thus much; he that overcomes ſhall be reſtored to life by Chriſt, to whom he will communicate himſelf. 'Tis an argument of Chriſts deity.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Angel of the Church in Smyrna]</hi> It was writ to this, next, becauſe next to <hi>Epheſus;</hi> to the Angel, to to-wit <hi>Polycarpus Johns</hi> diſciple, who was by him ordained Paſtor of this Church: whom Chriſt reproves not, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages to be conſtant, foretelling the perſecution of the Jewes raiſed againſt him; for they were the cheiſe agents pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the fire wherein he was afterward burned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe things ſaith the firſt and laſt,</hi> &amp;c.] Chriſt is firſt and laſt according to his divinity, but dyed according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>I know thy workes]</hi> That is, I approve thy works. Chriſt ſees and takes notice with delight of whatſoever is good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thy tribulation]</hi> Which thou haſt ſuſtained both of Jewes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:165674:15"/>and Gentiles for my name ſake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And poverty]</hi> Being ſpoyled of thy earthly eſtate by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of the truth; for publike ſale was uſually made of the goods of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But thou art rich]</hi> The faithfull are poſſeſſors of heavenly riches; for by faith they inherit Chriſt, who is to them all things, and heir of all things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the blaſphemy of them who ſay they are Jewes]</hi> The Jews who perſecuted the Chriſtians, blaſphemed Chriſt; counting him a deceiver, a magician, and juſtly crucifyed; ſaying, the Chriſtians were fooliſh men, and worthy of nothing but ſtripes: But Chriſt affirmes them to be a blaſphemous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation led by Satan to their deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And are not]</hi> He is not a Jew who is only outwardly one. We ſee titles availe nothing when men are degenerated from the truth.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Fear none of thoſe things which thou ſhalt ſuffer]</hi> This is a forewarning (and a forearming) againſt troubles at hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>None of thoſe things]</hi> Shewing that they muſt not expect one, but many ſorts of tryals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Satan ſhall caſt]</hi> Chriſt ſhewes that Satan is the author of theſe miſeries (as torments, baniſhments, martyrdoms which the word <hi>priſon</hi> notes.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Some of you]</hi> Not all, for Chriſt bridles him, and reſtraines him. Hence learn three things:
<list>
                        <item>1. The godly in this world muſt ſuffer affliction.</item>
                        <item>2. The deity of Chriſt in foretelling afflictions.</item>
                        <item>3. The devill the cheif author of all perſecution, who hates Chriſt and envyes mans ſalvation (Tyrants are but Satans inſtruments)</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That ye may be tryed]</hi> Here is the end of afflictions, that your faith and conſtancy may be more approved, and more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, (for though Chriſt know the hearts of his Saints, yet he will have their faith more apparent, that thoſe without and thoſe within the Church may take notice of it;) this ſhould teach the Saints to approve themſelves to God when tryed, by patient ſuffering. Satan then though he intend hurt in caſting ſome of them into priſon, yet God (whoſe ſerjeant Satan is) intends good</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:165674:15"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ye ſhall have tribulation ten dayes]</hi> Some comfort Chriſt gives them in this expreſſion, ſhewing the ſhortneſſe of the continuance of their tribulation. By ten dayes I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a ſhort time, and not the ten years perſecutions of the Emperours; which might rather terrify, then comfort them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be thou faithfull unto death]</hi> Chriſt exhorts him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy: for he that endures to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will give thee a crowne of life]</hi> 'Tis a Simile taken from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in a race where there is a crown propoſed as a reward to the conquerours, and it ſignifies eternall life. So <hi>Jam.</hi> 1 <hi>v.</hi> 12. This proves Chriſts divine nature, ſince he can give eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>He that overcometh ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death]</hi> A good reward (out of mercy, not merit) to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of eternall life. Note, the firſt death is a ſeparation of the ſoul (through ſin) from God, and was the cauſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall death. The ſecond is a caſting ſoul and body into the everlaſting lake of fire. He that is faithfull to the diſſolution of the body (ſayes one on this verſe) need not fear this ſecond death.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>To the Angel of the Church of</hi> Pergamus] Who he was, is unknown; only tis probable he was the ſucceſſor of <hi>Antipas,</hi> who was put to death by thoſe of <hi>Pergamus.</hi> Some ſay he was put into a brazen Bull, and by fire tortured to death. Now Chriſt ſends this Epiſtle to his ſucceſſour, to exhort him to conſtancy (who it ſeems was now in bonds) leaſt he ſhould be drawn aſide for fear of the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which hath a ſharp two edged ſword]</hi> To wit, his divine word.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>I know thy works]</hi> To teach they had to do with him who ſearcheth and tryeth the heart and reins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Where Satans ſeat is] Pergamus</hi> was the abode of King <hi>Atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi> and the devill reigned in City, Palace, Court and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; yet Chriſt had a Church there, as he had in <hi>Iſrael</hi> 7000 that bowed not the knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> though not known to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah.</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:165674:16"/>So in the Papacy a Church preſerved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My faithfull Martyr]</hi> Chriſt commends and honours him with this tittle to encourage his ſucceſſour to conſtancy, who in the dayes of <hi>Antipas</hi> and yet was faithful; though <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> was the moſt Idolatrous city of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and moſt perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>But I have a few things againſt thee,</hi> &amp;c.] Few in reſpect of the evils of ungodly men. Here we ſee there is no Church without failings. The Doctrine of <hi>Balaam</hi> and of the <hi>Nicholaitans</hi> they held; whether 'twas the ſame or not, few know; but perchance as the doctrine of <hi>Balaam</hi> was forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be allowed: ſo that of the <hi>Nicholaitans</hi> was neer it, as the community of wives, or polygamy: however it was a ſpreading hereſie. Here learn, 'tis lawfull to call Hereticks and Sectaries after the name of their Author, as Chriſt doth theſe <hi>Nicholaitans</hi> from <hi>Nicholas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Repent, or elſe I will come unto thee quickly,]</hi> It ſeems the Doctrine was countenanced by the Paſtor and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed to the ſcandal of the godly, the danger of the Church, and the reproach of the name of Chriſt by the Heathens: note, that repentance is the beſt means to divert a judgement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And will fight againſt them with the ſword of my mouth.]</hi> Chriſts word is to convince, wound, condemne and caſt off the irrecoverable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Them]</hi> To wit Paſtor and Church, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. Chriſt will not countenance a generall ſcandalous errour in his Church.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden Manna]</hi> He alludeth to the Omer of Manna layed up in a pot in the Ark. Chriſt is meant by this Manna; who is hid from the wicked, and reſerved for the Saints.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I will give him a white ſtone,]</hi> To wit, abſolution or remiſſion of ſins: for the ancients uſed in judgment to caſt white and black ſtones into a ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on; he that had the white, was innocent and abſolved; he that had the black, was guilty and condemned.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:165674:16"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And in the ſtone a new name written,]</hi> Tis an alluſion to the foreſaid cuſtom; for on the ſtones were written the names of the innocent and guilty, which being given them, the innocent were freed, the guilty condemned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A new name]</hi> To wit an excellent name, meaning of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſons — becauſe in the world to come the adopted have their full inheritance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which no man knoweth, ſaving he that receiveth it]</hi> Becauſe the happineſſe of Gods ſons here, but eſpecally hereafter, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expreſſed. Only they which are ſo, know what tis to be ſo. Here is an argument of Chriſts divinity, ſince he gives the hidden Manna, the white ſtone, the new name to them that overcome.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And unto the Angel of the Church of</hi> Thyatira,] Chriſt (Gods Son by nature) ſaid theſe things. Of other things in this verſe See <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14.15.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>I know thy works,]</hi> Good and bad, the good are four. Love to God, charity to the poor, faith which was ſhewed by the ſincere preaching of the Word, laſtly patience in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the laſt to be more then the firſt]</hi> It ſeems this Paſtour had lately, with much courage undergone ſome great tryall, for which Chriſt commends him. It ſhould teach us to encreaſe in the works of faith, love and the like.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>Notwithſtanding, I have a few things againſt thee]</hi> Not ſimply few, but in reſpect of the ſinnes of the ungodly; Chriſt alſo like a good Phyſician leſſens the diſeaſe, that the Patient may the ſooner admit the cure, and not deſpaire of amendment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Becauſe thou ſuffereſt that woman</hi> Jezebel, &amp;c.] Called ſo, becauſe equall in craft, power and (happily) malice, to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel, Ahabs</hi> wife. It ſeems ſhe was ſome famous ſtrumpet then in the Church, which held the doctrine of the <hi>Nicholaitans;</hi> for under the pretence (of liberty and Chriſtian charity) they taught, 'twas lawful to communicate with heathens both at bed and board.

                  <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>I will caſt her]</hi> here note a threefold judgement on her ſelfe; the bed on which ſhe was wanton, ſhall be a bed of ſickneſſe; for by a bed ſickneſſe is underſtood; where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve God puniſheth the ſin by an anſwerable puniſhment, a bed of ſickneſſe for a bed of laſciviouſneſſe. 2.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And all the Churches ſhall know]</hi> Here is the end and uſe of Gods judgements to declare his omniſcience, that he knows all ſinne, and his power to puniſh ſinners and wicked men. This ſhould teach us, ſeeing other mens judgements, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware and look upon Gods hand upon others.</p>

                  <p>NOt of <hi>Sardica</hi> where a Synod was held in the eleventh yeare of <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> But of <hi>Sardis</hi> the royal City of <hi>Craeſus;</hi> the Angel or Paſtor was not <hi>Melito;</hi> for he was not Biſhop of <hi>Sardis</hi> till ſixty yeares after in the reign of <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Pius;</hi> alſo he was a good Biſhop; but this is reproved for negligence and hypocriſie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe things ſaith he that hath the ſeven ſpirits of God]</hi> Though Chriſt may be ſaid to have (procured and ſent) the holy Ghoſt (called the ſeven ſpirits, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.4.) from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his Church; yet ſince theſe ſeven ſpirits are joyned with the ſeven ſtars or Miniſters, I rather underſtand created Angels; now they are called the ſeven ſpirits, not in relation to thoſe in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.4. but becauſe ſeven choice or principal Angels by way of preheminence. Now in the Preface of this Epiſtle Chriſt is deſcribed holding the ſeven ſpirits, and the ſeven ſtars, to note that as he upholds the Miniſtry, if ſincere, ſo he has Angels to defend the righteous, and oppoſe and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the wicked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I know thy Works]</hi> Obſerve three things: Firſt, Chriſts
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:165674:18"/>Divinity, ſeeing the Paſtor and Churches hypocriſie. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That all that make ſhew of holineſſe are not ſo; thou haſt a name that thou liveſt but art dead; ſome members of the Church are good, ſome bad. Thirdly, The efficacy of the Miniſtry doth not depend upon the goodneſſe of the Miniſter; Chriſt doth oft quicken and governe his Church by dead Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Thus it might be in the Papacy, where Chriſt had a Church before <hi>Luther.</hi> See <hi>ver.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Be watchfull]</hi> Shake off the hypocritical drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe into which thou art fallen, and ſtrive to live the life of faith again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Strengthen the things which remaine]</hi> Meaning thoſe dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing members in the Church by holy life and doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That are ready to dye]</hi> Therefore the Paſtor is exhorted to take ſpeedy care of their recovery being not quite dead, where obſerve, how mindful and careful Chriſt is of his poore people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have not found thy works perfect]</hi> Chriſt here reproves not the common frailties of the Saints, but ſome notable hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and defect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Before God]</hi> God looks narrower after truth then men do, though this Paſtor might paſſe for currant among men; yet Chriſt ſees a defect. Here note, Chriſt as man hath a god, but as a Son is God and life. This I obſerve becauſe ſome read, <hi>before my God;</hi> As <hi>Montanus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Remember therefore how thou haſt received, and heard]</hi> Becauſe this Biſhop or Paſtor was unmindful of the faith committed to him by the Apoſtles, Chriſt bids him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what he had heard of them; where obſerve, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to redreſſe corruptions of life or doctrine, is to have recourſe to the rule of the word. Alſo here obſerve againſt the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> that though Chriſt made that Promiſe to his Church, <hi>the Spirit ſhall lead you into all truth:</hi> yet not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Biſhop of <hi>Sardis,</hi> but all of the ſeven Churches but two were hereticks or hypocrites and much defective; and how comes it to paſſe that they are ſo infallible?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And repent]</hi> Forſake thine hypocriſie, and carefully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the duty of thy place: which though we cannot do of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:165674:18"/>our ſelves, yet they are unexcuſable who willingly diſobey the commandement. Of this ſee my quoted book <hi>page</hi> 46. <hi>lines</hi> 18, 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If therefore thou ſhalt not watch]</hi> Chriſt adds this commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to his exhortation, and that righteouſly; for if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented not upon ſo mature gentle praemonition, he deſerved a ſudden judgement to come upon him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As a thiefe in the night]</hi> Unawares; this doth not countenance or uphold a thiefe, becauſe Chriſt attributes the title to himſelfe, no more then when Chriſt bids his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants put their talent to uſury; he (perhaps) countenanceth that; yet when Chriſt ſpeaks of muſick in the receiving the Prodigal home in the Goſpel (intimating joy, and the peace of conſcience following his reconciliation with God through Chriſt) which was allowed in the Law, it proves the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of it (if lawfully uſed) ſince the joyes of a man in Chriſt are expreſſed by it, as I have noted in my little fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted book, <hi>pag.</hi> 84, &amp; 85.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Thou haſt a few names in Sardis]</hi> Meaning, a few true beleevers, though ſome were dead (or ready to dye ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) yet Chriſt reſerved a few to himſelf notwithſtanding the negligence of the Paſtour. See <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. Chriſt had ſeven thouſand that never bowed the knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> though the ten Tribes of Iſrael were fallen away; in the Papacy ſome who reſiſted the abuſes of the times unto bloud.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A few]</hi> Gods flock is a little flock; for though many are called, few are choſen. It is not the beſt to follow the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Who have not defiled their garments]</hi> Their conſtant ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is ſet forth by this metaphor: By garments is meant, that as their bodies were not polluted by the filthy luſts of the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholaitans,</hi> ſo their ſoules were not not ſtained with that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious doctrine. The body is our garment with which we are cloathed; righteouſneſſe and faith (in Chriſt) is the ſoules garment, which they had kept ſomewhat undefiled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They ſhall walk with me in white]</hi> Alluding to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Kings and Conquerours which was white, thus in ſcorne Chriſt was cloathed in earth; now as he is glorious, ſo
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:165674:19"/>his Saints ſhall partake of his glory; note, the Saints righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in earth (though white in ſome degrees) is defiled in reſpect of this in heaven, therefore they groan till cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they ſhall walk]</hi> It notes the Majeſty of the Sons of glory; and perchance the curious queſtion of ſome Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Divines may hence receive light, that the Saints move and walk from place to place in heaven after the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For they are worthy]</hi> Not in reſpect of merits and works, but of free grace; for they are worthy whom Chriſt eſteems his Sons, and hath made worthy. So Chriſt calls them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Behold me and the children God hath given me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>I will not blot out his name out of the book of life]</hi> Since the names of the Elect are ſaid to be written in heaven, that is, they are ſure and certain of eternal life, obſerve two things.
<list>
                        <item>1. Believers obtain not ſalvation by chance, but were elected of God through Chriſt from eternity, and known from them that periſh.</item>

That the Elect are certain of life; none can pluck them ont of Gods hand; God is ſaid to have books metaphorically, for he needs none, but doth all things by his foreknowledge, counſell and judgement; he is ſaid to have three books in Scripture; one of Providence, wherein he hath ſet down how every thing ſhall come to paſſe; when the wicked are deſtroyed, (who are equally written here with the righteous) they may be ſaid to be blotted out of his book. Gods ſecond book is of Predeſtination and eternal life, out of which none can be blotted His third is of the general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which tis ſaid <hi>the books were opened. ch.</hi> 20.</item>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I will confeſſe his name]</hi> an honour beyond thought to be called by name (as it were before the Throne and Angels, and to be acknowledged publickly. This might ſtirre up in us a care to get the firſt white garments of grace, that we may enjoy theſe of glory and this glorious acknowledgement. I omit <hi>ver.</hi> 6. being eaſie.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Angel of the Church in Philadelphia write]</hi> Some conceive this to be <hi>Quadratus,</hi> a diſciple of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:165674:19"/>Apoſtles, whom <hi>Euſebius</hi> mentioneth. <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote to theſe Philadelphians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That is holy]</hi> becauſe he is in himſelf holy, and made to us of God ſanctification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And true]</hi> conſtant in keeping promiſe and loving truth, hating falſehood and hypocriſie. As this is an argument of Chriſts being God out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. ſo tis an Argument that the Pope is Antichriſt, calling himſelf not only holy but holineſſe; and whereas Chriſt cals himſelfe but a great high Prieſt in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. the Pope cals himſelf the greateſt high-Prieſt, ſhewing himſelf not to be Chriſts vicar, but the ſucceſſor of the Pagans Arch-flamens or Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Who hath the Key of David]</hi> or of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> to wit, the Church; by Key, power is noted, for Chriſt hath an abſolute power over the Church as Lord and head of it, and hath committed the miniſterial power and keyes to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and their Succeſſours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He openeth, and no man ſhutteth]</hi> to wit, the doore of grace, and heaven, and Scripture: men are already blind in the things of God, yet he may for further puniſhment darken them more and more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No man ſhutteth]</hi> becauſe none can hinder his from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in at his opened doore, or can pluck them out of his hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He ſhutteth, and no man openeth]</hi> becauſe whoſoever is not elected and drawn by Chriſt can never enter; this proves Chriſts deity; for the Apoſtles miniſterially doe it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18 and <hi>Eliakim</hi> as high-Prieſt. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.22.—but Chriſt abſolutely.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>I know thy works]</hi> I approve thy good works. Chriſt praiſes his good parts to encreaſe them; particularly becauſe he had kept his word, and not denied his name; in the former he commends the ſincerity of his doctrine; in the latter his conſtant Profeſſion of the ſame before the adverſary. But leaſt this holy teacher ſhould be lifted up to think he did ought by his owne ſtrength, Chriſt tels him he ſet before him an open door, that is, 'twas by Chriſts power, that the Church over which he was Paſtor, embraced the truth.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:165674:20"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For thou haſt a little ſtrength]</hi> outward help and aſſiſtance, or any what in thy ſelf without me? ſo that tis Chriſt that opens. Chriſt had opened a door in <hi>Sardis,</hi> and gathered a Church, (which though the Paſtor had little outward means or help) he would ſo defend that none ſhould ſhut or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it. Sometimes by an open door is meant an occaſion or opportunity of doing good. Our Apoſtle ſaid there was a door opened to him in <hi>Troas;</hi> ſo tis Chriſt prepares the hearts of the People to receive him tis he that preſerves the People that do receive him. Chriſt hath opened a door in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kingdomes, though Antichriſt did his devoire to ſhut it.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>I will make them of the Synagogue of Satan]</hi> this is a tacit anſwer to an objection that might be made; for ſince both unbelievers of Jews and Gentiles oppoſed, it might be queſtioned how this Church could ſtand, and not be ſhut? to which Chriſt anſwers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will make them, or give them, &amp;c]</hi> ſhewing his power above theirs, ſo comforting the Paſtor; alſo it might comfort him thus, that if theſe unbelievers did moleſt him, Chriſt did but uſe their innate malice to teach him and the Church patiently to relie on him, and that it ſhould prove good to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Synagogue of Satan]</hi> The Jews called themſelves ſo from <hi>Judah,</hi> which in Hebrew ſignifies to praiſe, as if they had been the Praiſers of God; but they lyed, being enemies to Chriſt, and of the <hi>Synagogue of Satan;</hi> ſo then hypocrites vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brag of their glorious titles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will make, &amp;c]</hi> Here is comfort that theſe oppoſing Iews ſhould in time be converted, and reverence him as their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, and worſhip God, both which are noted in theſe words, <hi>ſhall worſhip before thy feet,</hi> as a dog fawning on one. This notes the inſufficiency of man to convert himſelf; tis God makes, alſo tis not the miniſter. <hi>I will make,</hi> ſays Chriſt, note alſo the mercy of God, thoſe of the Synagogue of Satan ſhall worſhip. Chriſt not only comes by perſuaſive but effectual means of grace, to gaine man, who is averſe to, and blind in every thing of God naturally, and ſo gains the will (not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:165674:20"/>forcing it,) which after works freely through the means of grace.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my patience]</hi> Chriſt out of a fatherly love and mercy promiſes a reward to obedience; be cauſe he had kept his Word, the reward was, that he would deliver him, either in the approaching perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Emperour <hi>Trajan,</hi> (See <hi>Plin lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Ep.</hi> 97. that he commanded the accuſed Chriſtians to be put to death) or in regard of the perſecutions of Antichriſt, which troubled theſe and all the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From the houre]</hi> this comforts the Paſtor that it was but a ſhort trial, and therefore the more chearfully to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To try them]</hi> This notes the uſe and end of affliction, that 'twas not for deſtruction, but trial and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which dwell upon the earth]</hi> God tries hypocrites as well as his faithful People, the one ſhew their conſtancy and faith in trial, the other their corruption in Apoſtacy. Thus the chaffe is winnowed from the wheat.</p>
                  <p>Verſ 11. <hi>I come quickly]</hi> here is another uſe of comfort, ſince Chriſt will come quickly to deſtroy the wicked, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the righteous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hold that faſt which thou haſt]</hi> to wit, faith and a good conſcience. By faith they had righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and adoption, —and a good conſcience helped them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in ſincerity and patience under the Croſle, which were therefore to be kept.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That no man take away thy Crown]</hi> this notes the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous effect of ſlothfulneſſe, ſuch loſe their Crown. Obſerve three things.

                     <hi>Theſe things ſaith the Amen]</hi> Aman in Hebr. ſignifies veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: now Chriſt cals himſelfe ſo, becauſe he is true both in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and threatnings, that by promiſe-keeping he might win this hypocrite from ſinne: or by threatning, and aſſuredly (without repentance) puniſhing he might deterre him.

Therefore he takes upon him this name here, becauſe the hypocrites he was to deal with, being grown ſecure, it ſhould ſeem begun, to eſteem of the faith of Chriſt as a thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and that for the cauſe thereof they needed not ſuffer affliction, or contend with the Oppoſers, thus then the more plainly to taxe their luke-warmneſſe, he declares his truth and faithfulneſſe, concerning his being a faithful witneſſe.

                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot]</hi> Neither were theſe Laodiceans enemies to Chriſt, nor true friends, but ſerved Chriſt and the world alike, as occaſion ſerved.

Certainly tis a worſe thing not to follow the truth we know in ſincerity, then to be ignorant altogether thereof. Hypocrites, and thoſe that have faith only in ſhew, and think that they ſee, but are blind, are greater enemies (yet with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion) to Chriſtians, then thoſe who are quite cold. One may be ſooner hurt and deceived under the name of a friend then of a foe. A Pagan alſo were ſooner gained to Chriſt then a Jew or Hypocrite. Here you may ſee what to think of the members of Antichriſt, who joyne Chriſt and Belial, Images and Scripture, God and gaine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>I will ſpue thee out of my mouth]</hi> the metaphor is taken from warme water, which is loathſome to the ſtomack, it notes the hypocrites creeping into, and being in the Church with a forme of Godlineſſe, but to be caſt out, becauſe want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power thereof.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>For thou ſayſt I am rich]</hi> either becauſe many rich Merchants were in this Church, and therefore they boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as having all wordly comforts, (though they be weak ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove our being in Chriſt, to reaſon from outward bleſſings, or rather becauſe hypocrites do imagine they are rich in ſpiritual things, wanting nothing, here is their Pride al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reproved.</p>

                     <hi>Becauſe thou ſayſt thou art rich, and knowſt not]</hi> ignorance was the cauſe of their pride, they knew not themſelves nor their own wants. The beſt way to beat down pride, is to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and know our ſelves.</p>

                     <hi>That thou mayſt be made rich]</hi> he that enjoys much gold is in the world accounted rich; but tis not gold, but faith that poſſeſſeth Chriſt and all his treaſure, which will make us rich in Gods account.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And white raiment that thou mayſt be clothed]</hi> becauſe we are naked, Chriſts garment of righteouſnes (which is white &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polluted) he adviſes to buy, there are two white garments men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned on <hi>v.</hi> 5. where the heavenly glory is meant as a reward of victory after this life: but here the Robes of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is meant, with which we muſt be cloathed in this life, that ſo we may be acceptable in the ſight of God. 'Tis thought alluſion is had to the Romanes, who when they ſought for an office in the Common-wealth, came clothed in white to the place of Election, by their garments teſtifying the integrity which becometh Magiſtrates.</p>

                     <hi>And annoint thine eyes with eye-ſalve that thou mayſt ſee]</hi> Becauſe he was blind, the meaning is, to ask of God the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the ſpirit, by which their darkned hearts may be enlightned.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>As many as I love I rebuke and chaſten]</hi> here note the difference between the afflictions of the Saints and the wicked, theſe are chaſtiſed as children, but the wicked are condemned and judged to hell.

                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>Behold I ſtand at the doore and knock]</hi> Formerly Chriſt compared himſelfe to a Merchant and Phyſician freely ſelling the Merchandiſes and ſalves of ſalvation; now to a wayfaring man (but a rich one) who yet ſtands (to note his care and diligence for to forward our ſalvation) at the doore: doth preſently go away, though the doore be not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened. The doore here is our heart which is naturally ſhut againſt Chriſt, yet Chriſt knocks more then once or twice, even till it be opened, it notes the aſſiduity and conſtant or continued care Chriſt hath of us. Chriſt knocks many waies; Firſt, By the preaching of the Law and deſtruction. Secondly, By the Goſpel and free pardon of ſin. Thirdly, By laying the croſſe of affliction. Fourthly, By his ſpirit. Outwardly we heare Chriſt knocking when we attend upon the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Inwardly, when we imbrace the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And open]</hi> Chriſt hath the key to open, though he be ſaid to knock; we open to him when we ſavingly apply the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Goſpel; for then Chriſt with all his benefits enter into our hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will come and ſup with him]</hi> Here are three mercies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. Firſt, He will come together with the Father and the Spirit and dwell in our hearts, an infinite favour, greater then if Kings ſhould dwell with us and make our Cottages their Palaces.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Will ſup with us]</hi> Chriſt ſups with us when by faith he makes us partakers of his word, ſpiritual Sacraments, when he delighteth in our faith and converſation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>And he with me]</hi> Chriſt is rich, comes loaden with bleſſings to communicate to us the good things of the Goſpel. I willingly omit any cavils upon the words. Chriſt knocks, it is certainly ſpoken to capacity, we have not a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to open till he bring the key, for we are dead by nature, now what power is there in a dead man, till Chriſt doth by his powerful knocking awaken us?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>To him that overcometh]</hi> He ſhuts up the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle with an accuſtomed concluſion. It is a promiſe upon victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>I will grant to him to ſit with me on my Fathers Throne;</hi> but note the condition taken from Chriſts example, <hi>As I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:165674:23"/>overcame and am ſet down with my Father.</hi> Chriſts throne is the glorious power of his exaltation, for the word. Throne notes Majeſty and Power, ſo that Chriſt will make his really partakers of that his glory if they overcome, for they ſhall be coheires with him, ſo yet as there ſhall remaine a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able difference betwixt Chriſt the head and the members.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 22. Is eaſie by what hath been delivered.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Epiſtles to the ſeven Churches, that to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia</hi> ſeemes to be the excellenteſt, next to which that to <hi>Smirna,</hi> the ſharpeſt to <hi>Laodicea.</hi> They all are (almoſt) for ſubſtance alike, I mean, conſiſting of three things: Firſt, A deſcription of Chriſt the Author of the Epiſtles. Secondly, The praiſe or diſpraiſe of each Angel, being a narration. Thirdly, Good things are promiſed to thoſe that overcome, and deſtruction to thoſe that fall away, which may be called in other termes thus: A Preface, a Narration, Exhortation, and Exclamation of Promiſes annexed.

The Emrauld and this Jaſper are alike much, and repreſent his divine Majeſty.

                  <p>
                     <hi>It was round about the throne]</hi> Becauſe he is cloathed with mercy, let him look which way he will, there is the Rainbow like the delightſome Emrauld, to ſhew how he delights in Covenant-keeping, in Promiſe-keeping, and in mercy. You ſee then here was God the Father repreſented ſitting and reigning in the perſon of his Son, ſo he that formerly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>John</hi> walking among the ſeven golden Candleſticks, now appeares ſitting on a throne, ſometimes under one figure Chriſt is repreſented, ſometimes under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

They ſit on thrones, becauſe with Chriſt they ſhall judge the world: They be ſaid to be Elders becauſe of their wiſdome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cloathed in white raiments]</hi> Here is the Prieſtly dignity of Saints ſhadowed out (as by crownes on their heads, the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:165674:24"/>Kingly is) white, undefiled robes become Prieſts, alſo the purity of Saints in heaven is hereby ſignified, their Garments being waſhed in the blood of the Lamb. Crownes note their reigning with Chriſt; this is the crown of life and glory.</p>

But how can this be well underſtood of the foure Evangeliſts; ſince <hi>Iohn</hi> was yet alive? I underſtand the State of the Chriſtian Church triumphant, who are of divers forms becauſe divers Nations and peoples are now under the Goſpel received, but the 24.

                  <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>The first was like a Lyon &amp;c.]</hi> The Church is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed from her gifts, a Lyon notes fortitude, a Man wiſdom, an Oxe labour and induſtry, an Eagle ſharp ſight, as in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>

Thus the <hi>Seraphims.</hi> In that their wings are full of eyes, it denotes that full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect light or knowledge which the Church enjoyeth with God in heaven.</p>

                     <hi>And they reſt not day and night, ſaying, Holy, Holy, Holy &amp;c]</hi> But inceſſantly praiſe God (for they are never weary.) Now note both Beaſts and Elders praiſe God; here is the excellent conſent and harmony of Prophets in the Law, and Apoſtles in the Goſpel, acknowledging Chriſts holineſſe, power, and Godhead.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>The</hi> 24. <hi>Elders fell down before him that ſate on the throne &amp;c.]</hi> Roſe from their ſeat, and fell down before the throne, giving due worſhip and reverence to him that ſate thereon.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Verſ. 1.</hi> And I ſaw when the Lambe opened one of the Seals, &amp;c.]</p>
                     <p>NOw the book begins to be opened, for Chriſt now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals unto <hi>John</hi> the Councels of God, which were yet hidden and ſhut; he ſhewed to <hi>John</hi> in types which he made him underſtand; but he ſhews us the types, only concealing the myſteries, that we might exerciſe our ſelves in the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent obſervation of things, both from hiſtories and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>One of the foure beaſts ſaying come and ſee]</hi> the beaſts it ſeems performed the office of publike Cryers, whoſe work it is to call Perſons neerer the Throne of Judgement-ſeat; they in order call <hi>Iohn</hi> who ſtood afarre off, either for reverence, or that he might more certainly write down what he ſaw.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As the voice of thunder]</hi> The firſt beaſt was like a Lyon, who now called to <hi>Iohn to come and ſee,</hi> (requiring hereby great Attention) and hence this Lyon-like voice as of thunder.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And I ſaw and behold a white horſe]</hi> to wit, went out of the book or ſeale, for indeed as all the myſteries were
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:165674:28"/>in the book, ſo upon opening it they came out, that is, were expounded to <hi>Iohn;</hi> now if the book were ſo great to contain a horſe and man, how great was he that held the book? how great he that opened it? how great were the myſteries and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents? The white horſe denotes the Purity of the Primitive Church, compared to that warlike creature, an horſe, becauſe the Church militant ſhould fight againſt the world, fleſh and divel.</p>
                     <p>The rider is Chriſt, who was ſwiftly carried on in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Apoſtles and other faithful Teachers in the firſt times. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> bare his name before the Gentiles; the Bowe is the Word, by which he wounds the hearts of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that he may heale and reſtore them to life: the Crown notes his Regal Crown of triumph, becauſe he goes forth <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering;</hi> by his death he conquered ſinne; by his reſurrection, death, hell, Satan, and the world, and tyrants. <hi>Iulian</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate confeſſed ſo much in his blaſphemous ſpeech, <hi>thou haſt overcome O Galilaean:</hi> he conquers hereticks, he conquers, converting ſinners, many ways he conquers; which for brevity ſake I omit. Chriſt in one reſpect opens the book, in another comes forth conquering, the firſt as the chief Prophet God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the laſt as God and King.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And when he had opened the ſecond Seale, behold a red horſe] John</hi> is called to ſee the future condition of the Church under perſecution; behold tis blood-red under many tyrants, tis the ſame Church though called another, becauſe of its differing colour; the rider I take to be Chriſt (not Satan) who is with his People in all miſery, <hi>He came not to ſend peace on the earth, but a ſword and fire,</hi> yet by accident (not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) becauſe of the malice of Tyrants and Hereticks oppoſing truth.</p>
                     <p>Verſ 4. <hi>And that they ſhould kill one another]</hi> Hereticks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a colour and pretence of Chriſt, perſecute and kill the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt; learn hence, the divel can do no more then Chriſt will ſuffer for our good, to wit, the exerciſe of faith. Chriſt ſuffers tyrants to afflict his Saints.—</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Loe a black horſe, and he that ſate on him had a paire of ballances in his hand]</hi> To wit, the Church in her afflicted condition by wicked hereticks, who cloud the light of the truth
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:165674:28"/>with their black hereſies, and bring in a deformity upon the Church, who was formerly white. I omit the names of the Hereticks, who in the age following the Apoſtles, till the time of <hi>Greg.</hi> the firſt (though they profeſſed themſelves Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) overthrew Chriſtianity; after alſo the faith of Chriſt was oppreſſed, and way made for Antichriſt, who ſhortly after came into the Temple of God; when <hi>Boniface</hi> the third ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the primacy over all Churches from <hi>Phocas</hi> the uſurper. Thus the white horſe became black, yet Chriſt rides on it, with the ballance of holy Scripture in his hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rides]</hi> For the worſt and groſſeſt Heretick profeſſeth Chriſt: 2. By his providence rules them, for in greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of hereſies he is not wanting to his Church, as they came not unawares, but for the tryall of his Church, ſo they are continually examined and confuted by the ballance of his word, he ſo ordering it, for a ballance is the tryall of juſt or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt weights: ſo Scripture is a true touchſtone to try gold and braſſe.—</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And I heard a voyce in the midſt of the</hi> 4. <hi>beaſts</hi> &amp;c] 'Twas the Lambs voyce in the midſt of the Throne, and foure beaſts, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.6. proclaiming a famine of the Goſpel, for through the ambition, Luxury covetouſneſſe and negligence of Biſhops, the Goſpel ſhould be ſo corrupted; and by Here ticks ſo adulterated that nothing ſhould be pure and ſound; by wheat in this place, ſincere teachers are meant, who ſhould be rare; by barley, the comforts of the Goſpel, which ſhould be ſcarce, though ſome underſtand a plenty hereby, ſince a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of wheat and three meaſures of barley ſhould be ſold for a penny, a meaſure containted a quart, being a mans allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for a day a penny was neer 7 pence with us, if ſo, then Chriſt in the midſt of all hereſies had truth<note n="*" place="margin">The penny was wages for the day as Mat <hi>20.13.</hi> now a meaſure (being as much as a man could cat in a day) was to be had for the penny or dayes labour.</note> enough for his people.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>See thou hurt not the Oyle and the Wine]</hi> By Wine and Olye ſome underſtand the Orthodox faith which ſhould not be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally obſcured by heretical blackneſſe. Now as Wine Cheriſhes and Oyle clenſes, ſo ſound doctrine doth glad and cleanſe the conſcience. <hi>Alcaſar</hi> applies Oyle to the light and true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of happineſſe, and wine to ſpirituall joy which the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:165674:29"/>Lambs voice promiſeth the Elect ſhall not be deprived of, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the dearth of truth by the darkneſſe of hereſie: Which happened partly, when the whole world groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Arrianiſme.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 7, 8. <hi>And I looked; and behold, a pale horſe, &amp;c.]</hi> This fourth beaſt having the for me of a flying Eagle, with quick fighted eyes, having ſpied ſomething (as it were on high) cals to <hi>John,</hi> for I beleeve hereby may be ſignifyed theſe plagues coming from above, to revenge the injuries done to the Saints, and to puniſh the impenitent. This pale horſe is the ſame Church of Chriſt in the ſucceeding age, though of another colour. <hi>Pale.</hi> becauſe it is infirme, weak, ſickly, neer unto death and hell: it by accident was occaſioned by <hi>Conſtantines</hi> exceſſive bounty to the Church, for then Paſtors began to be proud luxurious, idle and fertile in vices. <hi>Jerome</hi> complained in his time, that after Princes became Chriſtians, the Church indeed was greater in power and riches, but leſſe in vertue; the remote cauſe was, the guile and malice of that old ſerpent the devil. Alſo now Biſhops by infinite ceremonies, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man traditions increaſed the pale diſeaſe; Nay Monks (whoſe (at firſt) ſolitary, hard life wrought much upon the people) increaſed this paleneſſe for people that deſired pardon for ſin, were ſent to the Monks dennes (not to Chriſt) whereby this mortall wound came upon the Church, drawing more to hell then either the blacknes of hereſies or ſword of tyrants, though this might ſeeme rather to be expreſſed under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the darkning the Sun, and rolling up the heaven, then by the pale-horſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He that ſate opon his back was death,</hi> &amp;c.] Though Chriſt doubtleſſe was carried up and down as rider in the Church (for all profeſt him) yet ſince in works they denied him; death the effect of ſin is ſaid to ſit upon his back, drawing hell, for that waits on death without Chriſt) after him. Now though by beaſts, beaſtly luſts raigning in the ſouls of the people (through the negligence, ſlothfulneſſe and ſecurity of Biſhops) wounding and killing many: may be underſtood; And by famine, that of the word <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11. By the ſword, the wounding tongue (which cuts like a ſharp raſor, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.2.) or falſe wounding
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:165674:29"/>doctrines of Hereticks ſuffered in the Church: by death, the ſpiritual death, for want of Chriſt the life and the Goſpel: the food of the ſoule (for I heare not of a perſecuting ſword in this age) yet certainly there is a plain alluſion to <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14.21. where the Lord threatens <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for her Apoſtacy, with his foure ſore, that is, ſome cruel puniſhments, to which Chriſt likens here the curſed effects of ſecurity in teachers and hereticks, wounding doctrines, deſtroying a fourth part, that is, a great part of the earth under the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:165674:30"/>proclaiming <hi>Boniface</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. univerſall Biſhop and Prince of Prieſts (or indeed Antichriſt) then the Chriſtian world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be horribly ſhaken, for now Chriſt the Son of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe began to be obſcured, (that is) the doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his offices and benefits darkened; the Moon or Church turned into blood; the Starres or Paſtors fall from heavenly offices, the opened Book of Scripture, or the Heaven rolled up and forbidden to be read; the mountains, Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (for they are higher then the other people) in Jeopardy. The Ilands brought under Antichriſts yoak and tyranny: Firſt of the earth-quake, ſometimes tis taken in a good ſence, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>I will ſhake heaven and earth,</hi> meaning, in reforming the world by Chriſt. Note alſo that the ſignes foretold to be at the laſt day (<hi>Math.</hi> 24.) in the Sun and Moon, ſhall litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally come to paſſe; when the Iſles ſhall fly away, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were not found; to wit, at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>But here the Earthquake ſignifies the ſhaking and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Church by Antichriſt, who darkened the Sun, to wit, Chriſt, and the true light of the Goſpel; and the Hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Monkes who wore garments of ſackcloth (glorying of perfection) do (as by a true badge) teſtifie that they live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this darkneſſe ſpoken of.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:165674:31"/>laſt day from the ſight of the Lamb, who formerly made the poore ſervants of God thus hide in dens and caves. Now what ſhall become of the ſeries of Antichriſts if their inſtruments be thus puniſhed? if the ſerpent be curſed, woe to the divel himſelf.</p>

                     <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And they cryed with a loud voice, ſaying, ſalvation to our God]</hi> The Angels, Elders, Beaſts, nay the whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of heaven ſing joyfully to God and the Lamb: but the Antichriſtian adverſaries ſay to the mountains fall on us; this thankſgiving of the heavenly inhabitants is indifferent plaine, therefore for brevity ſake I omit it.</p>

                     <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>They have waſhed their robes in the blood of the Lamb]</hi> hence their whiteneſſe; hence they are before the Throne, or enjoy felicity, not becauſe of works or martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome then.</p>

                     <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>They ſhall hunger no more]</hi> Hunger and thirſt and heat are put for all the defects and troubles of this life as tears note the afflictions and ſorrowes of it, which Chriſt will deliver them from; for he will feed them with ſatiety of joyes in his preſence; And will lead them to the fountains of living waters of comfort. <hi>For in his preſence is the fulneſſe of joy,</hi> as in his abſence are miſeries for evermore.</p>

Here note an alluſion to be had to the Types of the Old-Teſtament, where the Prieſt went to the Altar, whereon continuall fire was preſerved; <hi>And he took a golden Cenſure, and he put incenſe therein,</hi> which being kindled by the fire of the Altar, was reſolved into an odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous ſmoke acceptable to God. Now in heaven there is no Altar but Chriſt, who as our high-Prieſt appears, being God and man, who ſanctifyes the prayers and endeavours of the Saints with the Cenſure, that is, his moſt precious death and paſſion, which he applies to the Saints; which is expreſſed in that he offered up the Incenſe with, or to the prayers of the Saints. Thus by prayer Chriſt offering up the Incenſe of the application of his paſſion unto it, the Saints may get the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſts death, and conſequently of eternall life: Now upon Chriſts offering himſelf up for us, and upon the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, comprehended under the word voyces; there followed the thundering of Tyrants, the lightnings of Hereſies (you ſee they be dangerous) and the great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake of Antichriſt ſpoken of <hi>chap.</hi> 6.12. where obſerve that this part of the Viſion agrees with that in <hi>chap.</hi> 6. Chriſt at the Altar giving ſeven Trumpets to ſeven Angels, here reſembles Chriſt on the white horſe there. The thundering here after the voyces, or preaching of the Word, and the fire of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:165674:34"/>Altar ſent, or Spirit given to the Church, reſembles Chriſt on the Red horſe. The lightning which burnes, deſtroyes and makes look pale (as experience teſtifyes) reſembles CHRIST on the pale and black horſe of ſickneſſe and hereſie.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>The Angels prepared themſelves to ſound]</hi> To wit, now after that Chriſt had ſent his ſpirit, till then the Apoſtles were not to departed from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor theſe Angels to ſound; Thus then the ſeven Seals and Trumpets agree, and perhaps the voyals for Chriſt ſignifyed the ſame thing to <hi>John</hi> under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall formes.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>The firſt Angelſounded, and there followed haile,]</hi> By this expreſſion, the contradictions and perſecutions of the enemies of the Goſpel are ſet forth; for as haile is hurtfull to green Corne, ſo is oppoſition and gainſaying unto young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers; fire and blood reſemble perſecution and baniſhments which happened to the Diſciples when the Goſpel began to be preached from Penticoſt, and forward as the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles witneſſe; it has alluſion to the ſeventh plague of Egypt, and agrees with the firſt Seal; by this means moſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and cheif Teachers in the Primitive time, meant by trees, were burnt up or deſtroyed; And divers (even very many) Saints as green graſſe (being weaker then the trees) were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, at leaſt bodily. This may teach all ſincere Teachers to expect at leaſt haile, that is, contradiction, its well if not fire and blood; let us be however, like the trees planted by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſide. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And the ſecond Angel ſounded, and as it were a great mountaine burning with fire,</hi> &amp;c.] This Mountain I beleeve not to be immediatly the devil as ſome think, but the Roman Empire (for he began not to burne with envy againſt the Church now, but was a murderer from the beginning) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſtirred up to do this miſcheif by the devil. Now the Kings and Emperours or Empires, are mountaines, is ſaid <hi>chap.</hi> 6.14. being higher then ordinary; but what high mountaine was in the world now (in this ſenſe) but the Roman Empire? The Sea is the gathering together of waters, and by it either the world or Church is underſtood. Now the Roman Empire
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:165674:35"/>violently ruſhed in upon both, and in the Church with fiery rage oppreſſed many thouſand Saints, witneſſe the many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions. Thus the Church was the red horſe, red with the blood of Martyrs; Many in the Church bodily were deſtroyed underſtood by creatures dying in the ſea.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the third part of the ſhips were deſtroyed]</hi> That is, many Teachers who under Chriſt, were able to manage the Sea or Church; (ſee the skill that ought to be in the Miniſters of the Goſpel,) but their ſouls were not loſt, though they were bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed, ſince Chriſt was aboard: but here is comfort, not all, but the third part of the ſea was blood; alſo the Sea quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth fire, ſo the Church through Chriſt ſhall have the victory at laſt. And perchance it might be ſpoken, becauſe the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire ſhould embrace the faith of Chriſt as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did. Thus the mountains was ſwallowed up with the ſea, but by this means Antichriſt was neerer home.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And the third Angel ſounded, and there fell a great ſtar from heaven.]</hi> Here as <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. are denoted all Arch-he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, who for many years after the Apoſtles deformed the Church: but eſpecially here is ſignifyed the Apoſtacy of the Biſhops of Rome, as it were falling by degrees; For indeed above thirty Biſhops before <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> for the moſt part ſhined as ſtarres in heaven, and ſuffered martyrdom for Chriſt; But after peace brought in by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> (tis pitty ſuch fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould do hurt) the Roman ſtar like the Babylonian Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer (or the devil himſelf) began to lift up himſelf above his fellow Miniſters—<hi>Sylveſter</hi> is ſaid to be the firſt that much degenerated, burdening the Church with Heatheniſh rites and ordinances.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>On the third part of the Rivers]</hi> By Rivers I underſtand the Biſhop (ſucceſſor of <hi>Sylveſter</hi> and other Teachers) from whom divine doctrine ought to flow to others: By fountains I underſtand the Scriptures: by waters the comforts and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Scripture infected.</p>

                        <hi>The ſtarre was called Warmewood]</hi> From the effects of it, becauſe it did imbitter.—Thus alſo did <hi>Arrius</hi> that Heretick imbitter the Rivers (partly by force, partly by cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) that who drank did indanger their ſalvation, here is an

                     <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And the fourth Angel ſounded, and the third part of the Sunne Was ſmitten,]</hi> In the ſixth Seal there is a totall Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clips threatned, the Sun ſhould be as dark as ſack-cloth of haire, that is very dark; but here only the third part of the Sun is ſmitten, yet the apparitions much agree; or as the pale horſe noted the ſickly eſtate of the Church, (of which ſee the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition) ſo ſomewhat of the ſame thing is here foretold; the Sun ſhadows out the cheif Prelates, as Pope &amp; Cardinal, who ought to ſhine forth in life and doctrine; the Moon which receives her light from the Sun, ſignifies other inferiour depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding orders, as Prieſts and Curates.—The ſtars being leſſe in light, ſignifie the layity (thus <hi>Annonimus</hi> upon the place) all which grew ſickly pale and dime in the matters of Chriſt, yet here is comfort only the third part, for Antichriſt was not yet lifted up into his ſeat.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And I beheld, and heard an Angel flying thorough the midſt of heaven] John</hi> ſaw this Angel fly in the midſt of heaven, which noted ſome notable Miniſter living in the Church or Kingdome of grace, who ſpoke of the miſeries of the Church enſuing; 'tis conceived <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhop of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was meant by this Angel, who as a heavenly Herauld foretold of the grievous calamities to befall the Church by Antichriſt, witneſſe his Epiſtles to the Emperour <hi>Mauritius.</hi>

                     <p>NOw follows the fift and ſixt Trumpets, the fift prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the diſſipation of the Weſtern Europian Churches by Antichriſt. The ſixt, the deſtruction of the Eaſt by the means of the falſe Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the Turks after him, theſe began to blow together as it were, of which hiſtories ſufficiently teſtifie.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>The firſt Angel ſounded, and I ſaw a ſtar fall from heaven unto the earth]</hi> who this Angel or Miniſter was, is not certainly known (perchance the ſaid <hi>Gregory</hi>) upon whoſe preaching this ſtarre fell; but the ſtar notes ſome notable Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, falling from the heavenly truth to earthly traditions and doctrines of divels,—certainly as Chriſt did not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the divel by this ſtarre (fallen long ſince, of which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iohn</hi> needed not to be informed) ſo certainly 'twas not <hi>Luther</hi> a poor Monk, who had little, and left nothing behind him, except footſteps of Reformation. The ſtarre notes ſome notable Prelate long before him, who began to ruine the Weſt, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> did the Eaſt, and 'twas none but the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> (ſignified by the ſtar, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. who burning as a Lampe, that is, clearly and gloriouſly (as the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> did at firſt) yet did fail at laſt, and together with <hi>Arrius,</hi> (not <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who neither was one of the ſtars of heaven, that is, of the Miniſters of the Church, nor did ever ſhine, being a wretched villain always,) imbittered the waters by falfe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, traditions, hereſies. Now to whom or what Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical perſon can this be applied, but to the Anti-chriſtian A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome? Gregory,</hi> as all know, makes him to be Antichriſt that ſhould affect the title of Univerſal Biſhop. <hi>Boniface</hi> the third his ſucceſſor, three years after his deceaſe, was declared by <hi>Phocas</hi> the intruder, (as all agree) univerſal Pope, chief Prieſt, or Biſhop of Biſhops. Behold the Star; though this is not to be applied to <hi>Boniface</hi> alone, who ſate not on the chayre ſcarce a yeare, but to his Succeſſors the whole Series of Popes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Key of the bottomleſſe pit]</hi> by Key power is meant,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:165674:36"/>(for he that hath the Key of the houſe hath the power of the houſe.)</p>
                     <p>Now the Pope ſays he hath the power of hell or the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit, to damn whom he will, and to deliver whom he will; thus he is the Angel of the bottomleſſe pit, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.</p>
                     <p>God permitting, the divel tempting, <hi>Phocas</hi> gave him this power, behold the man; Chriſt then though he gave the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> (and all other) the Key, that is, power of binding and looſing, caſting forth, and receiving in, according to the word; yet the Pope having thrown away Chriſts Key, he makes uſe of Satans uſurped one. This his triple Crown can prove, whereby his power over heaven, earth and hell is meant; but enough his practice makes him known. Where note Chriſt hath the Key properly, as head of the Church and Mediatour; the Pope uſurpingly and deceitfully, as Angel of the bottomleſſe pit, (not of the Church) or ſinke of hell; alſo God ſuffers the ſin, by it to puniſh another ſinne, to wit for not receiving the knowledge of the truth, ſee 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24, 26.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And he opened the bottomleſſe pit, and there aroſe a ſmoke out of the pit.]</hi> Hell and the doctrine thereof was ſhut up by the Prophets and Apoſtles who led men to the true fountaines out of the ſnares of Satan, but the Pope has open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the deſtruction of poore ſouls; behold the ſmoke of the pit, I mean the Popes black divinity, worſhipping of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, forgiveneſſe of ſins by Maſſe, Pennance, Almes, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages—of which the Volumes and practice of Papiſts ſufficiently teſtifie. Now as ſmoak doth hurt the eyes darken the aire, cauſe things not to be ſeen as they are, ſo doth the doctrine of Papiſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the Sun and the Aire was darkned by reaſon of the ſmoke of the pit.]</hi> Chriſt the Sun of righteouſneſſe was obſcured for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in part by Hereticks; but after the fall of this ſtar much more (as the times after <hi>Boniface</hi> the third make known) the Aire (ſignifying the Church) as receiving light from the Sun (as the Church doth from Chriſt) was darkned: and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for if the doctrine of Chriſt be darkned, how ſhall the Aire or Church have light? Thus 'tis plaine, though the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:165674:37"/>profeſſe they know God, <hi>yet in works they deny him;</hi> Note, that ſome by Aire underſtand the Scripture which conveys the light of the Sunne (as the Scripture doth the light of Chriſt) which was much darkned by Popiſh doctrines and expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; If the Aire ſignifie the Church, yet Chriſt had the ſealed ones, and conſequently a Church notwithſtanding this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe among the Papiſts.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And there came Locuſts out of the ſmoke]</hi> After the falling of the Star; Firſt, the bottomleſſe pit was opened (there the Angel of the bottomleſſe pit takes the Keyes, to wit, abſolute authority upon him.) Secondly, there followed ſmoak, to wit, divelliſh doctrines. Thirdly, the darkning of the Sunne and Ayre, Chriſt and the Church. Fourthly follows the generation of the locuſts; they are ſmall creatures, having little wings, by which they lift up themſelves a little from the earth; and ſeem rather to leap then to fly, but in ſome parts of the world there be ſome have bigger bodies. God plagued <hi>Egypt</hi> with an Army as it were of locuſts. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> did eat them as well as wild honey. Pray mark; do not the Monks, Fryeryes, and religious Orders (as they call them,) come out of the gulfe of the ſea of <hi>Rome?</hi> ſure not by Chriſts authority or his word; the opening of the pit brought them: ſo then the Goths army cannot be here underſtood, which came not out of the pit; but the Popiſh Clergy, who ſeem to be holy, to fly a little from the earth, but indeed are as the locuſts, gorbellied devourers, and earthly; ſome are greater, behold the Biſhops and Cardinals. —And as the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> did eate locuſts, ſo ſome have fed on thoſe (as I may ſo ſay) but with this difference, to their deſtruction. Who as locuſts skip in the Summer, ſing and delight in eaſe, but the Romiſh Clergy where are greater troops then of Locuſts? Where then of Fryers? What creatures deſtroy more then the Locuſts? Who more then the Romiſh Clergy? who devoure widowes houſes, gather infinite riches without labour, build Colledges&amp; palaces; but as the Locuſts, do good neither to God nor man.</p>
                     <p>If it be objected that theſe cannot be underſtood of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Clergy becauſe <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. theſe cannot hurt the ſealed ones, but Antichriſt and his inſtruments ſhall kill the two Witneſſes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 7.</p>

                     <p>I anſwer, they may kill them, yet not hurt them (in this ſenſe) the outward killing (of which in its place) may befall the Saints, not the inward hurting of the ſoule, for they are ſealed by election, redemption—</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And power was given them as the Scorpions of the earth have power]</hi> The Locuſt being a little weak creature, has power on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hurt herbs and flowers, which it deſtroyes much; but theſe Locuſts in the text have a power like a Scorpion; now the Scorpions hide under ſtones and clifts of wals, and hurt and poyſon unawares thoſe that paſſe by; alſo a Scorpion is a little worme and no way terrible to the ſight: Thus the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Clergy ſeem little but have great power from Antichriſt and Satan; God permitting to puniſh thoſe that obey not the truth,) they ſeem as friends, no way terrible, but deſtroy both eſtates and ſouls for their own gains, and as Scorpions lie hid, ſo Monks and Fryars—out of Cels, Monaſteries and Fryeryes unawares, wound thoſe that come to them, by falſe doctrines, confeſſions, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Verſ 4. <hi>And 'twas commanded them that they ſhould not hurt the graſſe of the earth]</hi> to wit, by God, who hath a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret reſtraining Providence, ſo that theſe locuſts cannot rage and range over all; by graſſe underſtand the godly; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance the ſame may be underſtood by green things, though ſome underſtand the Civil Magiſtrate; for by green things ſome conceive green wood is meant, which is ſtrong (no doubt the Civil Magiſtrate may deal with wicked men, ſuch as the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts, Antichriſt, and thoſe that are without). Now Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends theſe Magiſtrates who withſtand popiſh doctrines, from the hurt of the locuſts. By <hi>trees</hi> underſtand ſuch godly Paſtors and Teachers (who are ſtrong and rooted in Chriſt Jeſus) as contradict the wicked devices of Antichriſt; none can pluck theſe out of the fathers hand; thus God had an unhurted Church in the Papacy before <hi>Luther,</hi> yet not the Papacy; here the ſeeding perchance of the ſpiritual locuſts is noted, not on graſſe, herbs, or the like, but on cates and delicates, but chiefly hence obſerve that the locuſts can hurt only the diſobedient, (and that by a juſt power and puniſhment from God on them) and the unſealed ones, as <hi>chap</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And it was given them that they ſhould not kill]</hi> The
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:165674:38"/>firſt limitation was that the Popiſh locuſts ſhould hurt only the unſealed ones (of which ſort Antichriſt and the locuſts are) the elect Chriſt preſerves from the mortal biting of the locuſts. 2. They ſhould not kill men: but torment them. 3. The limited time ſhould be five moneths; theſe Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal locuſts were not (as the Gothes and Vanda's had,) to kill preſently, but perchance by a worſe lingring diſeaſe, to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and torment the conſciences of men, as by penance, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, merits of good works, pilgrimages, purgatory, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,—by which deceitful doctrines the ſouls of men (as on a rack) are continually wracked, not being taught true Juſtification by the blood of Jeſus. Thus God by the locuſts juſtly puniſheth thoſe that receive not the knowledge of the truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Five moneths]</hi> doubtleſſe here is a definite and certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber put down for an indefinite and uncertain; by it is meant — a ſhort time which God had ſet theſe locuſts, and their biting which they cannot paſſe. Now if it be objected, that their biting hath laſted long; know a thouſand years with the Lord, are but as one day; God be thanked, long ſince many kingdomes feel not the ſmart of theſe locuſts: their biting in my native countrey <hi>Ireland</hi> (and other places) has begun long ſince not to be forcible: and ſure the five moneths with us in <hi>England</hi> are already <hi>expired:</hi> we fear none of thoſe Popiſh <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And their torment was as the torment of a ſcorpion &amp;c.]</hi> when a ſcorpion biteth a man (to take the ſenſe of the place) the pain at the beginning is not great, but ſuddainly ſo increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that if remedy be not had, it will within few houres kill the wounded perſon; ſo though men regard not at firſt the biting of the ſpiritual locuſts: yet at the houre of death, if not before, all things appear horrible and mortal.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And in thoſe dayes men ſhall ſeek death and ſhall not finde it]</hi> Here is noted the condition of mad men, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how this biting ſhall infatuate, befoole and beſot people; theſe little ſpiritual Locuſts have many yeers even befooled many Kings of the earth and (otherwiſe) wiſe men; ſome have layed down the Scepter, and taken themſelves to Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:165674:38"/>perſwading themſelves (ſo theſe Locuſts have wrought on them) that eternal life was comprehended under a Monks hood; and that a little holy water (as they call it) can purge ſin, whereby their conſciences have been ſo troubled (want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true peace and comfort of Chriſt) that they deſired ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die then live, ſo that they might be out of this torment: but they ſhall not obtaine death, nor lay violent hands on wayes terrible to men not acquainted with Chriſt) yet to ſhun the former torment, like mad men they ſeek it.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And the ſhapes of the Locuſts were like unto hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes prepared unto battel] John</hi> really in the Viſion (as I may ſo ſay) ſaw this ſtrange monſter, as 'tis here deſcribed, which ſignified the Romiſh Clergy; now by the effects and adjuncts we may ſee how theſe Locuſts are ſhaped like horſes; for theſe Locuſts are fatted in their Cloyſters as horſes in a ſtable, and being ſtrengthned by the King of Locuſts the Pope, having the Devil (as a furious rider) on their back, they oppoſe the Goſpel of Jeſus, and are ready upon command given, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy either King or Prince (thus they furiouſly ruſh upon any as the Horſe into the battle.) Note, that as Chriſt in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times had a godly company of Teachers that carried him on the white horſe, ſo Satan &amp; Antichriſt are in ſome ſenſe carryed by the Locuſts or ſpiritual war-horſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And crownes on their heads]</hi> Either becauſe the Fryers cut and ſhave their haire crown-wiſe; or in reſpect of the great kingly power the Popiſh Clergy uſurpe over the conſciences of men, though according to the letter it may be taken; for the King of Locuſts (the Pope) wears a triple crown of pure gold upon his head. O brave <hi>Vicar!</hi> and the Cardinals, Biſhops, Abbots—ſhine like Princes, that one may demand, is this thy ſons garment?</p>

                        <hi>And their faces were as faces of men]</hi> Meaning the Popiſh Clergy; who becauſe they do not marry (yet do worſe) as others do, but live retiredly, and ſeparate themſelves from men and the world (as Monks—) becauſe they alſo are more wily and ſubtile then ordinary men (and for many other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which for brevity ſake, I omit) they are ſaid to be but like men.</p>

                     <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And they had haire as the haire of women]</hi> They delight to cheriſh and ſoften and dreſſe their haire (and by a ſynecdoche, other things practiſed by women, are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended here) thus the Romiſh Locuſts are effeminate, uſing much curioſity to ſhave and compoſe their haire, to wear gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous and ſilken apparell (as women.) —</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And their teeth were as the teeth of lyons]</hi> Here is noted their cruelty; though they pretend mercy, piety, religion, many poor ſouls have they cruſhed by their tortures; witneſſe the inquiſition of <hi>Spaine;</hi> which though made and pretended for the Moores, yet deſtroyes Chriſts ſervants. Alſo by their lyons teeth is underſtood their ſnatching all things, devouring widows houſes, laying waſte Orphans fields. By their lyons teeth the Romiſh Clergy in their writings and diſputations tear the Truth.—</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And they had breaſt-plates,</hi> &amp;c.] Iron breaſt-plates keep off blowes; ſo theſe ſpirituall Locuſts are not eaſily hurt. For firſt their Prieſtly priviledges exempt them from any civill power; ſo that the Magiſtrate dare not touch (without endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering the Popes curſe). Secondly, they have Kings, Princes and great men to patronize and protect them. Thirdly, they are by ſeverall orders, ſocieties, fraternities, vowes, —ſo linked together, that as they may hurt any, ſo none may hurt them.</p>

The Chariot notes majeſty (and terrour if in a battle, whether they oft carry Princes and Generals); ſo theſe by their priviledges are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, their ſermons ſpare none, of what rank or quality ſoever, keep all under with fear of excommunication.</p>

His name (from the effect) may be well called <hi>Abad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> or <hi>Apollyon;</hi> that is, a deſtroyer (in Hebr. and Greek) for he deſtroyes the Church.

(See <hi>chap.</hi> 8.) This voyce is from Chriſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the four Angels to be looſed as actors of the future tragedy.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Which is before God]</hi> As the Altar in the Viſion ſeemed to be before God; So Chriſt is in the preſence of God to appear for us, as our interceſſour. Concerning the four hornes, ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.10. they were Types of Chriſts expiation of our ſinnes.</p>

Now who more puniſhed the Chriſtian world then thoſe four Nations, <hi>Armenians, Arabians, Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens, Tartarians</hi> (from which laſt came the Turk, though now all four are comprehended under the name of <hi>Turkie</hi>). <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> formerly did bound the Roman Empire, ſeparating the Chriſtian world from the barbarous people who inhabited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it (where they were bound) but now looſed. So theſe Angels are four Nations; who at an appointed time brake forth with their hoſtile armyes upon the Chriſtian world in the raigne of <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour; the occaſion this; the ſaid Emperour having ended his warres with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without pay his Saracene ſouldiers which he had then in the army, which they not well liking, by the counſell of the falſe Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> after they had drawen the reſt of the <hi>Arabians</hi> into a ſociety and war with them, they with their captain <hi>Homar</hi> in ſhort time brought under the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Provinces of the Romane Empire, eſtabliſhing the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and rooting out Chriſtian Religion (which was much corrupted;) to theſe Arabians the Turks a people of <hi>Sythia</hi> (now <hi>Tartaria</hi>) joyned, profeſſing Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matilme; over whom (to be brief) <hi>Ottoman</hi> a Turk, became Emperour, who and his ſucceſſors ſince the yeere 1300. have ſubjugated great part of the world; ſo that <hi>Keckerman</hi> thinks Mahometiſme is more and larger profeſſed then Chriſtianity.

Either then by ſerpents tailes we may underſtand their deceit and fraud, or their ſhooting headed arrowes (and perchance poyſoned) upon their retreat.

                     <p>HEre in this Act are comforts for the godly under ſo long continued afflictions: as the fifth Seal contained the comforts of the Martyrs under the Altar, in reſpect of the evils of the foregoing ſeales; ſo this chapter belonging to the ſixth Trumpet doth containe conſolations againſt the evils of the foregoing Trumpets, which I have already mentioned in the preceding chapters.—</p>
                     <p>This mighty Angel is Chriſt, whom <hi>John</hi> ſaw in a Viſion deſcending from heaven, not by a local motion, but by the preſence of his Spirit and ſpecial help, to relieve the afflicted condition of his Church. Thus Chriſt has promiſed to be with his Church to the end.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Clothed with a cloud]</hi> This notes the majeſty of Chriſt, for God in old time oft appeared to the people in a cloud. So then Chriſt clothed with the cloud of our fleſh is not here meant, becauſe his birth is not here treated of, but his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:165674:42"/>coming to aſſiſt by his ſpiritual preſence, nor his coming in clouds at the laſt day is not to be here conceived, but <hi>chap.</hi> 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.—</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the Rainbow on his head]</hi> The Rainbow ſignifies mercy, becauſe God ſet it in the cloud as a ſigne he would not deſtroy the world by water any more, notwithſtanding the ſin of man. Chriſt comes to his poor afflicted Church as a Meſſenger of peace and mercy (who is our peace, and procured us mercy) a comfortable ſigne for an afflicted people, promiſing one day to his true ſervants eternal reſt and peace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His face was as the Sun]</hi> Noting two things, Chriſts glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied condition and his being the Sun of righteouſneſſe, illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating his Church, diſſipating the tempeſts of calamities, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing as it were by the clear beams of his countenance to diſpel adverſity from his people.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His feet as pillars of fire]</hi> Pillars note ſtrength to uphold, fire notes Chriſt refining his Church, for fire conſumes chaffe; alſo hereby is noted Chriſts conſuming his adverſaries and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; ſo Chriſt appears as upholder of his people, refiner of his Church, devourer of his adverſaries: Thus Chriſt the ſtrong Angel is above the Locuſts and like the Sun looks upon the rage of the four Angels looſed and the reſt of the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ready to ſupport, refine, conſume.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 2 <hi>And he had in his hand a little book open]</hi> This is the ſame book which was formerly ſealed with ſeven ſeales, which Chriſt opened and holds it ſo in his hand; 'twas leſſe now, then when the ſeven ſeales were one, for now many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents were revealed to <hi>John</hi> out of it, and the ſeales taken off.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why doth Chriſt open the book and now keep it ſo?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe Chriſt is the revealer of ſecrets, and of the will of his Father, and he keeps the holy Scripture open, ſo that the Locuſts nor their King (notwithſtanding the ſmoak of the bottomleſſe pit) can darken the truth of Jeſus totally; nor the armies of thè Barbarians could root up the faith of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Mark then, notwithſtanding all oppoſers of the truth the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:165674:43"/>book is kept open; for Chriſt raiſed ſome alwayes to defend his truth; furthermore he keeps it open for his two Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in <hi>chap.</hi> 11. to purge by it the dregs of the Locuſts and their King.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And he ſet his right foot upon the ſea, &amp;c.]</hi> Some by Chriſts right foot underſtand powerful miniſters, and by the left foot more weak ones; however Chriſt ſets his feet on ſea and land, that is, takes poſſeſſion of the world, as preſerving in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſome remnants of a Church to himſelfe, notwithſtanding the many perſecutions of tyrants, who endeavoured to root out the very name of Chriſt; mangre alſo the cunning endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of that old ſerpent by many hereticks, and by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome's</hi> falling from heaven to earth, turning the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt into wormwood, and opening the bottomleſſe pit; this is a great conſolation to the Saints that none can put Chriſt out of poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And he cryed with aloud voice as when a Lyon roareth]</hi> This lyon-like voice ſhews the efficacious ſpreading of the Goſpel, which ſhould and doth frighten the oppoſers, who the more they rage the louder the voice is, the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly the name of Chriſt was profeſſed, and this Chriſts loud voice did foretel, ſo that the enemies and oppoſers, though they did rage, yet they had a kind of ſecret feare in them.</p>

                        <hi>Seven thunders uttered their voices]</hi> Theſe repreſent ſeven, that is, a perfect company of thundering miniſters or Boaner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſes of the truth: who ſhould (upon the books being open, and the voice of Chriſt, (as the Lyons roaring,) to wit, in the publiſhing the Goſpel, notwithſtanding all oppoſers) undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly preach Chriſt againſt tyrants, hereticks, and Antichriſt, to make them unexcuſable.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>I heard a voice from heaven, ſaying unto me, &amp;c.]</hi> This voice did not abſolutely forbid the writing of what the ſeven thunders uttered, but in reſpect of the event, God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that the oppoſers would not hear but deſpiſe their voice, cauſing the ſame to be ſealed, ſecret and hid to them through their own default. Note that ſome Copies read <hi>(Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe things, write what the ſeven thunders uttered)</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:165674:43"/>here you ſee how true that of <hi>Paul</hi> is, <hi>the Goſpel is hid to them that are loſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And the Angel which I ſaw ſtand—lift up his right hand to heaven]</hi> So they did in old time that did ſweare; God once ſwore by himſelfe, Chriſt here ſweares by God. —Chriſt forbade not ſwearing upon a juſt occaſion, an oath ſo is the end of ſtrife; idle oaths Chriſt forbade, as by ones hair, head, <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>—by which none ever ſwore before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; raſh oathes then are forbid, not other.—Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Chriſts ſword as Mediatour and God-man by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who in that reſpect is greater then he.</p>
                     <p>Now in Verſ. 6, 7. <hi>And ſweareth by him that liveth for ever and ever, &amp;c.]</hi> follows what was ſworn, to wit that time ſhould be no longer: but the accompliſhment of the myſtery of God under the ſeventh Trumpet at the day of judgement, was at hand: but Chriſt is not to be underſtood, as if he had ſwore time ſhould be no more after that day, but ſhould be ſwallowed up in eternity; for what needed an oath to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme ſo apparent a truth? Chriſts ſwearing was to comfort the godly under tyrants, and eſpecially Antichriſt, who had eſtabliſhed his kingdome; as it made the Saints feare much more miſery (for it ſeemed ſo firme that it ſhould not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed) now Chriſt promiſes a time of Reformation tacit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; of which in <hi>chap.</hi> 11. alſo the ruine of Antichriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and that no more <hi>time</hi> of ſuch miſery and ſadneſſe ſhould happen to the Church. So the oath here is for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the promiſe, and for the Saints conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, &amp;c.]</hi> either of the Jews calling a little before the ſeventh Trumpet, (of whoſe calling the Prophets ſpeak, and <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 11.) or rather the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the reſurrection, (as <hi>Paul</hi> cals it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. behold I ſhew you a myſtery) and deſtruction of the adverſaries, of which ſee <hi>Zach.</hi> 14 <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. <hi>penult and Mal.</hi> 4. thus the ſixt trumpet ſhall continue (fulfilling) till the laſt day; then the ſeventh by the Arch-angel ſhall ſound, 1. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 4.16.</p>

True, ſeven thundring miniſters in the time of Antichriſt, and oppoſers preached undauntedly the truth of Chriſt, but without fruit; but now <hi>John</hi> muſt eat the book, by which is ſignified that the Goſpel is to be preached anew, (though not by <hi>John</hi> himſelfe) in the time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt with ſucceſſe; this book then written within and without, <hi>chap</hi> 5.1. is the Goſpel as well as the Revelation; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out is the known word of God, or the Goſpel, which Chriſt held open, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. in all the time of the hereticks, tyrants, and the kingdome of the locuſts; that within, the Revelation. This eating the book is a Preparation to the act of the two witneſſes fighting with Antichriſt, (of which in <hi>ch.</hi> 11.) which in ſome ſort is acting in this age. Hence obſerve that the open book doth manifeſtly ſet forth the myſteries of God, not the canons or traditions of Papiſts.—</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And eat it up, &amp;c.]</hi> So <hi>John</hi> did (however in the viſion;) to eat it, is to read, preach, meditate, digeſt, —ſo all miniſters ſhould be devourers of books, underſtand them before they preach.—Chriſt bids <hi>Iohn</hi> eat the book, and then prophecy. We muſt not then preſumptuouſly relie upon the extraordinary revelation of the ſpirit without reading.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And I took the little book, &amp;c.]</hi> 'Twas foretold <hi>Iohn,</hi> it ſhould be in his belly bitter, yet he readily takes the book. —So the bitterneſſe of the events ſhould not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten us from preaching,—now the word in it ſelfe is moſt ſweet, comfortable, bringing peace; but in the event it brings by accident bitterneſſe, gripings, hating the world, fighting with ſinne, nay and perſecutions, baniſhments, martyrdomes. This bitterneſſe to follow in the third act of this viſion is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told <hi>Iohn,</hi> that he might not be thereby troubled, being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy an exile.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And he ſaid to me, thou muſt propheſie againe, &amp;c.]</hi> The true pteaching of the Goſpel was deſtroyed by Antichriſt, but now to be renewed, purged from the dregs of Antichriſt. And the locuſts reformed, meant by <hi>Iohns</hi> propheſying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>

                        <hi>Thou muſt prophecie]</hi> hence I beleeve <hi>John</hi> was reſtored in time, and performed his office miniſtring to the Churches: but this proves not that <hi>Iohn</hi> is alive, and reſerved to preach towards the end of the world; for <hi>Iohns</hi> propheſying again did not ſo much concern himſelf, as other witneſſes to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up to reform religion, as he tels us in <hi>chap.</hi> 11. for ſince the ſeven thunders wrought little on the enemy, Chriſt raiſes up his two Witneſſes as defenders and maintainers of his truth.</p>

                        <hi>Verſ. 1.</hi> And there was given me a rod like a reed].</p>
                     <p>HEre Reformation is treated of. This rod was a meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſtaſte, ſuch as builders uſe to mete ground with when about building, to which the reed was like. Of this rod ſee <hi>Ezech.</hi> 40.5. by it is meant the Word of God by which the Temple, that is, the Church of Chriſt was to be reformed, and tis the very little book, of which before. Now the Word (as a rod) chaſtiſeth ſinners and reforms them. Here obſerve that the Temple or Church was ruined and waſted; then obſerve that the viſible Church could erre, ſince it wanted this reed. Laſtly, obſerve the Word is the beſt means and rule for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the Altar]</hi> The Altar is Chriſt, as is ſaid; now Chriſt needed to be reformed; how? becauſe under the pretence of the name of Chriſt, he was thrown out of doors, and the true doctrine of Chriſt (as the Sun was darkned before.) Now by the Altar the whole worſhip of Chriſt is to be underſtood, which by the corruption of hereticks and Antichriſt, needed meaſuring, rebuilding or reformation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And them that worſhip therein]</hi> meaning the true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of God in the midſt of Antichriſtian defilements; now to meaſure them is to ſever them as choſen members, or to ſeale them, (as tis ſaid of them <hi>ch.</hi> 7. for theſe are the very ſealed ones)</p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:165674:45"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therein]</hi> Though none (but the chief Prieſt) worſhipped in the Temple, other worſhippers ſtood in the Court; yet here the true worſhippers (becauſe of their coming near to Chriſt) are ſaid to worſhip in the Temple, being indeed the very Temple of the holy ſpirit. Concerning the Temple, Altar and Courts (to which here is a plain reference,) ſee 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. <hi>and Ezek.</hi> 40. where the Temple is deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>The Court which is within, caſt forth, and meaſure it not]</hi> The inner Court in the time of the Law was holy, and for the Prieſts and ſacrifice, (the outward was common, and therefore not to be caſt out,) now the Maſle-prieſts have an inner room hallowed, (in alluſion to the old in the law) into which the common People are not to come. <hi>Iohn</hi> muſt not mete this Court, but caſt forth; certainly by the Court the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are meant. So thoſe ſeemingly holy Prieſts of <hi>Rome</hi> are not to be meaſured or reformed, but to be declared as caſt out by the word, as none of the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For 'tis given to the Gentiles]</hi> Antichriſt and his miniſters are Gentiles, to whom the inner Courts are given to poſſeſſe and pollute. Thus thoſe ſeemingly holy Prieſts are Antichriſts ſervants, nay are Gentiles, being as idolatrous almoſt as they; worſhipping images, —and are caſt out in the ſight of God, and counted as heathens, though they colour and cover their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is given]</hi> God hath given this inner Court of Prieſts to Gentiliſme and Idolatry, by a juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the Holy City ſhall they tread underfoot fourty two moneths] Ieruſalem</hi> (who ſhould have been holy, and was by the Jews eſteemed ſo—) was a type of the Chriſtian Church, which was by the Romanes burnt and deſtroyed, which nation now again under Antichriſt was to tread under foot Chriſts Church. Nay thus, the man of ſin (in particular) hath exalted himſelf to be the Temple of God, trampling under foot the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> making himſelf king of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourty and two moneths]</hi> God be thanked, 'twill not laſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. Doubtleſſe by fourty two moneths a ſhorter time then to the end of the world is meant: elſe what needed the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:165674:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>at all? yet I confeſſe Antichriſt after <hi>Romes</hi> burning, (of which <hi>chap.</hi> 18. ſhall ſurvive and not be fully deſtroyed, nor his falſe Church till Chriſts coming, for he muſt deſtroy him with the brightneſſe of his coming, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9, 11. yet his tyrannizing ſhall end before that; indeed, if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed my judgement, I conceive the fourty two moneths ſhall expire, when <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be litterally burnt, which we expect daily: Though I confeſſe (to the praiſe of God be it ſpoken) Antichriſt hath in a great meaſure ceaſed to tread underfoot the holy City or Church (in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany, Sweethland</hi>—) long ſince, and perchance can't laſt but to the firing of <hi>Rome,</hi> which if wiſe men conjecture aright, will be 216 years hence. Doubtleſſe here is a definite number of moneths laid down for an indefinite, certain to God, but unknown to us. Learned men reſolve the fourty two moneths into years, each moneth containing thirty years, and the whole to ariſe to 1260 years. begin then at the time when the Gentiles began to trample underfoot the Church or holy city, (which was when <hi>Boniface</hi> uſurped the chayre, <hi>An.</hi> 606.) from what time to this, the Romane Antichriſt and his Gentiles have trodden underfoot the Church or holy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the ſpace of 1044 years, this being the yeare of our Lord, 1650. So there remains 216 years more for the City to be trod down, and ſo many years remain for the two witneſſes to preach againſt Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And I will give power to my two Witneſſes, and they ſhall propheſie]</hi> Some have thought Chriſt and the ſpirit or annoynting were theſe witneſſes: but Chriſt makes them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from himſelf, ſaying, <hi>I will give to my two Witneſſes.</hi> Alſo Chriſt nor the Spirit can't be killed as theſe were; Chriſt was to die but once; laſtly, the Revelation is an hiſtory (though myſtical) and in this particular almoſt literally fulfilled, as ſhal appear. Here alſo is a plain alluſion to <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> Zach. 4. ver. laſt, who brought literally <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of captivity (with <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua, Nehem.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. <hi>and</hi> 4.) And are called annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones. Now certainly the firſt Kings, States, and chiefly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel, who endeavoured to bring Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of Antichriſts ſpiritual thraldome are here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:165674:46"/>being a plain alluſion to the hiſtory of <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> as will appear. <hi>John Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> were the firſt witneſſes, olive trees and candleſticks of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in <hi>Bohemia</hi> and thereabout, who in their ſucceſſours propheſied or preached a thouſand two hundred and ſixty days; Of which anon. Not indeed as if the witneſſes ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver quite give over preaching before the laſt day in their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors: but becauſe chiefly they ſhould manifeſt their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, when Antichriſt was exalted, and trod down the Church in a moſt violent cruel manner. Certainly notice may be taken, that ſince <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prague, John Huſſe,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers began to witneſſe the truth of the Goſpel againſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, the truth hath increaſed farre and near. Thus whiles Antichriſt trod down the Church moſt, they witneſſed moſt earneſtly, and ſhall do till the burning of <hi>Rome,</hi> as will appear in this chapter to a diligent Reader. After which as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt will with weakned ſtrength ſurvive, ſo ſhall the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes powerfully to the end. But moſt notice is to be taken of the firſt fourty two moneths, and the thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty days, being all one, as ſhall appear.</p>
                     <p>Now if any yet object that annointed ones will not agree with Kings or Miniſters of the Goſpel; I anſwer, that neither <hi>Ioſhua</hi> nor <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> were as we read of annointed, yet Conductors of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Babylon, Nehem.</hi> 12.1. and called annointed, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. <hi>laſt.</hi> Now certainly every miniſter of Chriſt, nay every true Chriſtian is annointed with the ſpirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. but enough. Only note, that the firſt witneſſes had the ſpirit and power was given them in a peculiar manner to oppoſe Antichriſt, and therefore are called the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live trees. By the two witneſſes therefore we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the two teſtaments, who though they do teſtifie of Chriſt, yet can't be ſaid to be killed <hi>properly,</hi> and reſtored to life,—by two therefore, a ſufficient company of witneſſes we are to underſtand, (alluding to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>) who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by their ſucceſſors ſhould preach and maintain the truth of Chriſt, after the Court of Prieſts was departed from the Church to Paganiſm and idolatry, and Antichriſt had troden underfoot the holy city.</p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:165674:46"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They ſhall prophecy]</hi> Thus <hi>Iohn</hi> in the two Witneſſes doth prophecy again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes]</hi> Here is the ſame time allowed to the witneſſes to Propheſie, and to Antichriſt and his Gentiles to tread down; ſo that the beginning of the treading down the Church, and the Prophecying of the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was at the ſame time; for though Chriſt raiſed up two faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſes, that is, ſome more then ordinary towards the time of the Gentiles treading down and taking full poſſeſſion of the Church; yet he never from the firſt beginning to tread down, left himſelf without ſome witneſſes. <hi>Berengarius, Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Wickliffe,</hi> nay the very Romiſh Biſhops and Emperours have complained of the tyranny of Popes; after <hi>Boniface</hi> the thirds uſurping. Thus the witneſſes time of Prophecying is not yet expired, nor ſhall be, till the Gentiles give over treading down.—</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cloathed in ſack-cloth]</hi> Either becauſe they prophecyed, to gain men to repentance, ſackcloth and aſhes; or becauſe they mourned and were in bitterneſſe for the miſeries of the Church intimated by ſack-cloth: or becauſe they were poor and contemptible in the worlds eyes, not clothed with ſilk— as the Romaniſts.—</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Theſe are thoſe two Olive trees, and the two Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,]</hi> To wit, mentioned <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. meaning <hi>Jehoſhua</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> who brought the people from captivity. Where obſerve, theſe two witneſſes have ſome alluſion to theſe two, as to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſufficient witneſſes againſt <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and ſo by two witneſſes a ſufficient company are meant, to whom Chriſt gave, to wit, power to prophecy, that is, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and ability to teach his truth and oppoſe Antichriſt) when the holy city was much trod under by Antichriſt and his Gentiles; Chriſt raiſed up his two witneſſes, <hi>John Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Ierom</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> to prophecy againſt theſe Gentiles; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their martyrdom. God ſtirred up <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Zuinglius, Calvin</hi> and others to witneſſe his truth. But obſerve the dignity of theſe witneſſes; they are Olive trees and Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks; the Candleſtick bears up light, by which darkneſſe is expelled; ſo the witneſſes bear the true light, and bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:165674:47"/>of the true light. Then, an Olive is alwayes green, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth wholeſome fruit; ſo the Miniſtry of the witneſſes is efficacious and lively; and the oyle of the ſpirit (or the holy anointing) comes upon Gods people by it; perchance hence may be obſerved that Emperours, Kings and Princes (called ſon of oyle) out of zeal to God, might be witneſſes, refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of Religion, and nurſing fathers to the Church, <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel (Zach.</hi> 4) a Prince is called an Olive (in this ſenſe) and an anoynted one —then as <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> a civil Magiſtrate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>builded the Temple and city: ſo God raiſed ud faithful Princes and Magiſtrates as witneſſes of his Truth in every age of late.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Standing before the god of the earth]</hi> Here the dignity of the witneſſes is ſet forth; who though vile in the worlds eyes, yea in ſack-cloth, that is, poor, neglected, contemned, yet are acknowledged by the god of the earth, who therefore will regard them prophecying on earth.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>If any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth,</hi> &amp;c.] This fire is ſpiritually to be underſtood; the word is a hammer and a fire in <hi>Jeremy</hi> 23.29. Nay, and his Miniſtry is compared to fire, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.14. Behold, I will make my words in thy mouth as fire—and the people as chaffe. The fire is light and conſumes; ſo the word of the witneſſes ſhall detect the dark abominations of thoſe that hurt them, oppoſing their prophecy; they ſhall confound the Idols and Purgatory of Antichriſt, and refute his lyes. Thus the two witneſſes ſhall ſpiritually devour the Adverſaries; though otherwiſe they ſhall ſlay the witneſſes. Here is an alluſion to the fire procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias. Numb.</hi> 16. 2 <hi>Kings chapter</hi> 1. thus the Goſpel has prevailed over thoſe that laboured to hinder it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus be killed]</hi> The witneſſes of late ages as <hi>Luther</hi>— have thus ſpiritually undone and devoured poperie and the beaſt; ſeverall Kingdomes of late in ſome meaſure being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and Antichriſt there deſtroyed by the witneſſes and faithfull Miniſters of Chriſt, notwithſtanding all the plots, armes threatnings of the Adverſaries. So then, as the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes have (as it were) weapons; ſo they are not carnall, but ſpirituall.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Theſe have power to ſhut heaven that it rain not,</hi> &amp;c.]

Where obſerve the reaſon and cauſe of great puniſhment by famine, plague, war, was contempt of the word and witneſſes; thus the word and witneſſes accidentally bring miſeries.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Moreover when they have finiſhed their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> &amp;c.] The preaching of the Goſpel is called a prophecy and a teſtimony of Chriſt and the Truth.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:165674:48"/>goodneſſe of the cauſe. Thus <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> was overcome, and <hi>Wickcliffes</hi> bones were taken up and burnt; ſo was <hi>John Huſſe</hi> deſtroyed after he had prophecyed (even literally) 42 moneths; for from the firſt time he began to maintain <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffes</hi> opinions, being <hi>Anno.</hi> 1412. to his martyrdom were preciſely (ſay his friends) 1260 dayes or two and forty mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths. Now though ſome famous witneſſes were put to death ſuddenly after their finiſhing their teſtimonie, and ſo the beaſts treading down the holy city to be a time larger then that of the witneſſes (whereas the text gives both the ſame ſpace of 42. moneths or 1260. dayes) remember that the two witneſſes (in their ſucceſſours) revived and prophecyed again, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. So God has not leſt himſelf without a witneſſe to this houre, nor will not, till the Peaſt ceaſeth to tread under foot the holy city, or give over tyranniſing at leaſt.</p>

The former woes did belong to the godly and wicked alike under both Antichriſts, Turk and Pope, this only to the wicked. Now the cauſe of the heavenly rejoycing was in part, becauſe the kingdomes of the world (which the adverſaries had vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently taken into their poſſeſſion, and as much as in them lay thruſt out Chriſt) now returne to Chriſt; who (having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed his enemies) ſhall raigne alone, after which time Chriſt ſhall deliver up his Kingdom, (for now he rules by his word, Spirit, Sacraments, Miniſtery, as Mediatour—but then as God and one with the Father, for ever) of which ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. hereafter Antichriſt and the wicked ſhall not rivall with him; but our Lord and Chriſt, that is, our Lord Chriſt Jeſus alone with the Father and Spirit.</p>

Becauſe in another book I have touched this point, — and in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:165674:51"/>this page; Ile name the choiſe proofes of each ſide, and ſhew the more probable opinion; 'Tis ſaid, one is the glory of the Sun, another of the moon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.41. and ſo ſhall be the reſurrection; therefore one Saint in heaven is to outſhine ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Anſw.</hi> As <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> fol. 579. there is nothing ſaid of the glory of heaven; only as one ſtar outſhines another, ſo the bodies in the reſurrection ſhall much differ in glory from them as they are now ſowen in corruption. (as <hi>verſ.</hi> 42. ſpeaks) note, 'tis not ſaid, ſo ſhall it be after the reſurrection; (to wit, in heaven) but ſo is the reſurrection, therefore that place proves nothing. Now to this place I annex that of <hi>Math.</hi> 22.30. on the other part. We our Saviour ſayes, wee ſhall be like the Angels of God in heaven; now the Angels have but one and the ſame glory. But ſecondly, 'tis ſaid every one muſt receive according as he has done in the body, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. and it ſhall be more tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> in the day of judgment then — now if there be differences in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, why not in rewards of glory?</p>
                     <p>

Now nothing ſhines more, therefore all ſhal be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glorious; yet alike glorious. Thus that in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe is meant, for they that be wiſe are teachers in that place who inſtruct (as the Hebrew has it) and they that turne many to glory are Teachers too, now the ſame labourers are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:165674:51"/>to have the ſame (not a differing) reward (every one his pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> ſays they ſhall ſhine as the firmament or heaven of ſtars (which is all one) not as the ſtars (among themſelves) but gloriouſly as the ſtars. Fifthly, there is a greater and a leſſe in the kingdome of heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.19. A ruler over ten cities, and a ruler over five, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.19. and tis ſaid he that ſows bountifully ſhall reap bountifully,—2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. therefore there be differences of reward. <hi>Anſw.</hi> all theſe quoted places are to be applyed to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace, not of glory, and therefore prove nothing. The more carefully the Saints imploy their talent here below, the ſooner they are preferred in the Church, and the greater the preferment. And the more one ſows or gives to the Saints, the more temporal bleſſings God gives him, or the more grace; but enough. The more probable opinion is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcovered. Chriſt promiſes that all his ſhall be with him, and conſequently partake of the ſame glory, and if the twelve Apoſtles ſhall ſit upon thrones, ſo the twenty foure Elders do, nay all the Saints ſhall judge the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. and be glorified together, <hi>Rom,</hi> 8.17.</p>
                     <p>But enough for a digreſſion. I hope no tranſgreſſion. Ver. 19. <hi>And the Temple of God was opened in heaven, &amp;c.]</hi> There is no Temple in heaven, but the Church triumphant is here meant; the opening it is the manifeſtation of its perfect glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which ſhall be after the day of judgement (of which <hi>Iohn</hi> was even now ſpeaking) which is now hid and kept ſecret.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the Ark of the Teſtament was ſeen]</hi> Meaning Chriſt, (for the Ark in the Temple typified him) who was formerly ſeen in earth, (in forme of a ſervant) but now, after the great day in perfect glory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And there were lightnings, thundrings, voyces, &amp;c.]</hi> Here is a Preparation to the fourth viſion; and the lightnings—are the puniſhments to befal the wicked at the laſt day; God ſhall raine upon the wicked fire and brimſtone, ſtorme and tempeſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.6. —theſe things ſignifie the conſpiracy of the elements to take vengeance on the wicked, and may come litterally to paſſe at the laſt day.</p>

                     <p>TO <hi>John</hi> in a viſion, great in regard of the events.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A ſigne, to wit a woman clothed with the Sunne</hi>—] Some read it a wonder, becauſe the woman was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully clothed and delivered. To omit the ſtory of <hi>Eve</hi> and the ſerpent, and <hi>Mary</hi> with Chriſt perſecuted by <hi>Herod,</hi> (which are here (as it were) repreſented) doubtleſſe this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is the Church, (for women as the Church are weak, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on their husbands, fruitful—) ſhe is in heaven, partly becauſe ſhe appeared ſo to <hi>John,</hi> alſo the Church hath both her original and converſation in heaven, This viſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins (as it were) of Chriſts birth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Clothed with the Sunne]</hi> Becauſe the Church is clothed with Chriſt who is the Sunne of righteouſneſſe; the Church then in the general ſhall be ever ſafe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt her, yet particular Churches; as <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, Rome,</hi> — may erre and fall away as experience ſhews.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Having the Moon under her feet]</hi> By it is ſhewed the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable condition of the Church here below, ſometimes ſhining in full light, ſometimes ſcarcely to be ſeene; but rather here is noted the Churches deſpiſing and trampling underfoot all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary, vaine and periſhing things, poſſeſſing Chriſt — by faith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And a crowne of twelve ſtarres on her head]</hi> She profeſſeth the faith of the twelve Apoſtles (who are compared to bright ſtarres) which is a crowne (as it were) to her head: thus the Church is a crowned Queen, and the faith an adorning.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And ſhe being with child, cryed, &amp;c.]</hi> Alluding to women who beare not without paine, nor bring forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſorrow, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> not excepted. See my <hi>Glimps of Chriſts love,</hi> page 16.—The Papiſts cannot tell how to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:165674:52"/>beleeve that this place any way concerns the Virgin;—Wel, the Church cannot bring forth her fruit of Chriſt without cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, labour, ſorrow; the propagation of the Church ever was with great troubles, cares, cryes; thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> travelled in birth with the <hi>Galatians, chap.</hi> 4.19. tyrants make the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches paine the greater.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And there appeared another ſigne, a great Dragon, having ſeven heads, &amp;c.]</hi> Becauſe he is an old Serpent who has devoured other Serpents, and ſo becomes a Dragon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Red]</hi> Notes his cruel, bloodthirſty nature, perſecuting the Church. This Dragon is the Devil, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. the crowned heads of the Dragon are Kings, Emperours, Tyrants, as <hi>Herod, Nero, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi>—for ſeven is taken for many. By hornes, ſtrength is meant; by them Governours, Captaines—are meant, as <hi>Pilate, Feſtus</hi>—Now <hi>ten</hi> notes a great many; the Dragon differs from the Beaſt, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. (the deſcription of each makes it appeare) yet this Dragon begot that Beaſt, and are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what alike.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And his taile drew the third part of the ſtarres, &amp;c.]</hi> Now followes the action of the Dragon; he by his taile, that is by cunning flattery and inſinuation (for Dogs fawne with their tailes) drew or enticed many teachers of the Church (compared to ſtarres) to leave their heavenly function, and to fall to humane traditions and earthly cares — yet I rather by the Dragons tail underſtand (under ſeveral tyrants) many &amp; long perſecutions (for the Dragons taile is his ſtrength) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many (at leaſt ſeeming ſtarres) fell to the worſhip of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: Nay, ſome faithful teachers too, for a little ſeaſon; here are things noted firſt, yet not many yeers after performed. <hi>Eſay</hi> ſays, the Prophet that tels lyes is the tayle, <hi>chap.</hi> 9.15. Now perchance by Dragons taile, falſe-teachers and hereticks (as <hi>Arrius</hi>—) may be noted, who drew many from the faith. Now by this Dragons meanes that ſtarre <hi>chap.</hi> 8.10. <hi>&amp; chap.</hi> 9.1. fell to the earth, I mean the Romane ſtarre and <hi>Arrius</hi>—</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the Dragon ſtood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, &amp;c.]</hi> Like a hungry Wolfe before the fold to devoure the Sheep: <hi>Peter</hi> cals him a roaring Lyon (intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:165674:53"/>his hungring after a prey, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8.) Firſt when Chriſt was literally born, he fought to devoure him by <hi>Herod</hi> (when the children ſuffered for him, before he for the children) and ever ſince he ſtrives to devour Chriſt (the manchild) in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, by Tyrants, Hereticks, Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>This Act anſwers to the firſt foure Seals concerning hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. and to the <hi>Trumpet,</hi> concerning the fire mingled with blood, the burning mountain, the ſtarre falling; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the time from the birth of Chriſt, to the riſing of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. Now follows comfort in act the ſecond, being anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the fifth Seal, of the ſoules being under the Altar, <hi>chap.</hi> 6, 9. and to the Angel ſtanding on ſea and land, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.2.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And ſhe brought forth a manchilde, who was to rule all nations, &amp;c.]</hi> The Sexe notes ſtrength, thus Chriſt is the mighty God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Who doth feed]</hi> that is, rule all nations with an iron rod. as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. that is, with a powerful Scepter; the nations with an iron rod: but his People with his word, or as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 53. in green paſture, as a ſhepheard, not a tyrant. Is the devil a dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon? So then remember Chriſt is that ſtrong manchild, who by his power and iron rod defends himſelf in his members, whiles here below. Note by the womans <hi>bearing</hi> a ſon, many ſonnes, nay multitudes of ſons are ſignified, who firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And he was caught up unto God, &amp;c.]</hi> Chriſt litterally and the Saints ſpiritually are caught up into heaven, that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and protected, and after death (as the witneſſes) are caught up, or aſcend to heaven out of the danger of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, his heads or horns.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And the woman fled into the wilderneſſe; &amp;c.]</hi> Here that is ſaid to be done firſt, which was not done till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; to wit, when the Dragon was caſt to the earth, and the woman had wings, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. To which place I referre the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the interpretation of this verſe.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And there was warre in heaven; &amp;c.]</hi> After the manchilde was caught up to heaven, and before the ſcattering of the Church. <hi>John</hi> in the viſion ſaw the warre in heaven, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:165674:53"/>it ſignifies how Chriſt aſcending, overcame Satan, deſtroying his Kingdome bringing to the Saints eternal ſafety. <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> applies this to <hi>Conſtantines</hi> ſuppreſſing the enemies of Chriſtianity, which in part may hold. But doubtleſſe this war began before; Chriſt is <hi>Michael</hi> in this place, for the Angels can't be ſaid to be any other <hi>Michaels:</hi> though perchance <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw one Angel as Commander of the reſt in the Viſion. Chriſt and Satan fought in the temptation, bloody ſweat, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (when our <hi>Michael</hi> overcame (as <hi>Sampſon</hi>) by his death) but eſpecialy by his reſurrection and aſcenſion (though the whole myſtery of our ſalvation is here ſhadowed out) he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Dragon; and to this houre in ſome ſenſe, the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel from heaven laſts with the Dragon. This Viſion was to comfort the Church in her miſerable perſecutions, ſeeing at laſt her <hi>Michael</hi> prevailed and ſhe in him; now though in the Viſion more Angels fought (noting perchance how all his members muſt fight againſt Satan) yet Chriſt doubtleſſe trod the Winepreſſe alone, <hi>Iſa</hi> 63.3.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And prevailed not, &amp;c.]</hi> Chriſt ſits triumphing in heaven (and in his Church in great meaſure at this day) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no room for Satan there. <hi>I beheld him as lightning fall from heaven,</hi> ſays Chriſt; the preaching of the Goſpel, and Chriſts death caſt him out and deſtroyed his Kingdome. Thus Chriſt entred the ſtrong mans houſe (or kingdome) and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.29. perchance here is ſome alluſion to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans firſt caſting out of heaven.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>That old Serpent called the devil and Satan, &amp;c.]</hi> he is called old, becauſe of a long ſtanding, even before the fall. A ſerpent becauſe of his craftineſſe and poyſon of ſin, wherewith he infects the nature of man. A divel, becauſe an accuſer and ſlanderer of the brethren (for ſo much the Greek word ſignifies;) Satan, becauſe an adverſary and hater of mankind.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>he is called the Seducer of the whole earth, &amp;c.]</hi> for he hath deceived mankind generally; now this ſhews the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the benefit obtained by the victory, ſince ſuch an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and his Angels, (whereof <hi>Baalzebub</hi> is Prince) ſhould be ſpoyled, (ſignified by his being caſt out of heaven in the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:165674:54"/>Viſion); How Chriſt by his birth and death ſpoyled Satan, ſee farther my quoted book. <hi>p,</hi> 48.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And I heard a great voice in heaven, &amp;c.]</hi> Here follows the Song of the Church. The great voice notes the multitude of rejoycers, and the greatnes of their joy. The cauſe, becauſe the accuſer is caſt out; neither our ſin, ill conſcience, the law, nor Satan, can caſt thoſe out of favour who are in Chriſt Jeſus. I mean, their former ſinne and ill conſcience, of which 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.20, <hi>If our heart condemne us, God is greater then our heart, and knows all things;</hi> if we can truly ſay we love the brethren to wit, as the preceding verſes ſpeak. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Satans accuſing, ſee <hi>Iob</hi> 1. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. forward. Theſe things being eaſie to <hi>ver.</hi> 13 I paſſe them for brevity ſake, with theſe notes,
<list>
                           <item>1. The heavenly hoſt call us brethren; the accuſer of our brethren, a great dignity.</item>
                           <item>2. They rejoyce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſhall not be accuſed; ſee their love to us, for Satans accuſation could not hurt them, but us, who have not finiſhed our warfare; but now by Chriſts victory there is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Of which very largely ſee my Glimpſe of Chriſts love, <hi>pag.</hi> 60, 67. Where the particulars, life, death,—are examined.</item>
                           <item>3. Chriſt manifeſted his love, power, ſalvation—when he drew us as a loſt prey out of the Dragons jaws. Of which ſee the quoted book everywhere.</item>
                           <item>4. Though Satan cannot prevail with God by his accuſation, yet he ſtirs up many adverſaries in the world againſt us; therefore we ſhould walk very carefully, for Satan is not dead, though overcome.</item>
                           <item>5. The blood of Chriſt is the cauſe or means of our victory; by the blood of the Lamb they overcome, (the Lamb and <hi>Michael</hi> you ſee are the ſame, by whoſe death, paſſion, reſurrection, —the victory is obtained.)</item>
                           <item>6. Since Satan cannot prevail with God, but is caſt out of heaven and the Church, hee'l domineer the more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the nations, the inhabitants of the earth, by making them idolatrous, and bringing woes and miſeries on them. <hi>Wo to the inhabiters of the earth.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>7. Satans greateſt malice is againſt the manchild, the Church and Saints (whoſe happineſſe he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies) but hee'l play at ſmal game rather then ſit out, diſturb the earth rather then do no hurt.</item>
                        </list>
This Prophecy concerns the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:165674:54"/>times of Antichriſts riſing <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 606. and after, when Satan by Antichriſt and his Locuſts troubled ſea and land, Prieſts and people of Antichriſts Church, known by the name of Inhabitants of the earth.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 13 <hi>And when the Dragon ſaw he was caſt unto the earth, he perſecuted the woman &amp;c]</hi> Here the perſecuting of the woman is renewed by the Dragon, notwithſtanding the Church had got <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour (that man-child in ſome ſenſe) to profect her: for his exceſſive bounty to the Church did much hurt (as I noted <hi>chap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. about the pale horſe) by which meanes the venome of Pride, Ambition, Coveteouſneſſe, Luxury — was breathed into the Clergy, which miniſtred occaſion of new perſecution. Now alſo <hi>Arrrius</hi> (whoſe name is enough to tell the miſery of that age) moſt beyond thought vexed the Church; here the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon perſecuted the woman, for oft times the Emperours were <hi>Arrians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And to the woman were given two wings of a great Eagle &amp;c.]</hi> The Church after her many battles with hereticks and Tyrants, obtained <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to defend her; but by means of that peace brought to the Church by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> many ſins reigned in the Clergy, and the Church then began to take her flight into the Wilderneſſe; by that time Antichriſt aroſe ſhe was gotten thither, <hi>Anno</hi> 606. (for her flight was long, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe is ſaid to have Eagles wings, which Fowle flies longeſt and ſtrongeſt) So that Church which formerly was the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cloathed with Chriſt, having (as it were) a Crown of Apoſtolical faith to adorne her, is now fled into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; by it we are not to conceive any local flight, as into <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia deſerta,</hi> or the like: But the wilderneſſe here is oppoſed to heaven; now when the woman caſt off the graces of Chriſt and his robes wherewith ſhe was clad, and put on the whoriſh attire, ſhe ſo altered her viſage that ſhe ſeemed not the ſame; thus ſhe became inviſible more and more; true there were many that feared God in every Age, but they as the Church in <hi>Elias</hi> time were contemned and inviſible or unknown, rather keeping private in Families then publike in Congregations; Now (as we ſay in our proverbial ſpeech of any thing that is
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:165674:55"/>confuſed (or unweeded or overgrown as a neglected gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den—) it is a meere wilderneſſe; ſo) the Church by reaſon of her ſpiritual confuſion is ſaid to be a wilderneſſe, though formerly a chaſte Virgin. Note the Popiſh Church hath ever been viſible and flowriſhing, but not this woman, therefore that Church is not this woman, for ſhe became by little and little to live (as thoſe ſeven thouſand in Iſrael in the time of Idolatry) private and retired, hating the whore and her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Garments, Doctrine, Worſhip, and wayes, (though ſhe were perchance in the literal or local <hi>Rome,</hi> or that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Wilderneſſe.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eagles wings]</hi> Note the power of her deliverance, for they have ſtrong wings, not as a ſmall bird—By wings then I underſtand not ſo much the two Teſtaments, by which ſhe preſerved her ſelfe, but an alluſion to that foule who by her ſtrong wings flies far and ſtrongly out of danger; ſo the Church by faith flies toward heaven or out of danger into ſome private retiring place (like <hi>Elijahs</hi>) where ſhe is to be ſpiritually fed, as he was literally.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A time, and times, and halfe a time]</hi> So Antichriſt ſhall triumph not for ever, yet not a very ſmall time neither, but a time, yea, and times, known to God, not to us. I conceive (as my <hi>Paraeus</hi>) by this time the ſame ſpace is noted as formerly, to wit of 1260. yeares, which time is given to the reigne of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. So this Antichriſtian Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceeded in the roome of this chaſte woman, who was fled into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe or gotten out of ſight by that time he aroſe, and abode, and is to abide there till Antichriſt leaves off treading down the holy City; God be thanked ſhe hath been in ſome meaſure viſible a good while, and Antichriſts daies are partly expired; when their date is quite out, we doubtleſſe ſhall ſee the woman much more glorious and viſible; for the time of Antichriſt reigning is her hiding; and as he decreaſes, ſhe increaſes.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have heard of <hi>Romes</hi> corruption and inviſibility in reſpect of her former luſtre for the firſt three hundred yeares, which was by degrees, as the Eagle flyes, not at once, for the woman was a great while flying into the Wilderneſſe, even
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:165674:55"/>from a little after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to <hi>Phocas</hi> the uſurper who ſet up Antichriſt. None (whether Church, Kingdome, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) is corrupted at once, but by little and little.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And the ſerpent caſt out of his mouth water as a floud &amp;c]</hi> This floud I underſtand not to be thoſe Nations, <hi>Goths, Vandals, Almans</hi>—(who as a deluge came about this time to deſtroy the very name and faith of Chriſt, and to carry away the woman: nor by earth do I underſtand them (though their earthly religion ſwallowed up perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by embracing—Chriſtianity) for this helped not the woman, but drove her farther into the Wilderneſſe: for the faith was moſt corrupted by <hi>Arrius</hi> and other damnable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks when they embraced it, ſo they were for the moſt part Arrians, or Neſtorians—) becauſe <hi>John</hi> had treated of the Dragons perſecuting the woman before, therefore here, by the floud I underſtand the moſt wretched hereſies (now reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) vomiting out of the Dragons mouth, for the Doctrine of the Goſpel coming out of Gods mouth is compared to ſtreames of water, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38. and ſo hereſies may be well ſaid to be a floud, conſidering their violence and impurity, for a floud waſhes the banks — and draws all corruption into it. Now in this Age was <hi>Arrius</hi> againſt the Son, <hi>Macedonius</hi> againſt the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Neſtorius</hi> againſt the truth of Chriſts Perſon.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Yet the earth opened her mouth and ſwallowed up the floud, &amp;c]</hi> Alluding to the old hiſtory of the earths ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing up <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company, <hi>Num.</hi> 16. or to the earth ſwallowing up the floud which deſtroyed the World. In ſum God uſed ſome extraordinary meanes to deſtroy this floud, by which the Dragon thought to deſtroy the reſt of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſeed, that is, thoſe retired righteous (of which I ſpake but now) who withdrew themſelves from the Idolatry of <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe are deſcribed to be ſuch as have the teſtimony or Goſpel of Jeſus, whereby (and the bloud of the Lamb) they are ſaid to overcome, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. for the Goſpel brings faith that laies hold on Chriſt, by which all the Saints over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Thus we have ſeen what a furious Creature the devill is againſt us, and how he makes uſe of his ſhort time (which

                        <hi>Verſ. 1.</hi> And I ſaw a beaſt riſe up out of the ſea, &amp;c].</p>
                     <p>THis Viſion depends on <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. of <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. as one with it, the act deſcribes the Dragons war there mentioned, and Antichriſts ariſing, mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.7. by the beaſts aſcending out of the bottomleſſe pit, and agreeing with <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.8, 11. of the little horne ſpeaking blaſphemies, meaning <hi>Antiochus</hi> (or Antichriſt himſelf) of whom <hi>Antiochus</hi> was a Type. Now it is uſual in Scripture to ſet forth Empires by beaſts, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. where the Aſſyrian, Perſian, Grecian, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empires are ſo deſcribed riſing out of the ſea, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. that is, out of Nations, Tongues, People over whom they reigne, and from whence they ariſe, anſwerable to <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.15. This beaſt ariſes out of the ſea here, and out of the land, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. yet the ſame one according to the laſt verſe; here is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to count the number of the beaſt (in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) and that becauſe of Antichriſts double forme, as King and Prieſt, having the ſword of <hi>Paul,</hi> and key of <hi>Peter,</hi> as the whoriſh Church or queen, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.7. 17.3. and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.13. clothed with the ſpoiles of the Roman Empire, and pretended Vicarſhip of Chriſt, or as a Tyrant and ſeducer. Let then the Papiſts feigne an Antichriſt to themſelves to be begotten of a Jewiſh woman of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> by ſome evill ſpirit to reigne three yeares and an halfe, and to fulfill literally all things ſpoken Antichriſt, in this
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:165674:56"/>Book, we have found the man ſitting in the Temple of God, even for God—</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Out of the ſea]</hi> To wit the bottomleſſe pit, out of which the Locuſts came, <hi>chap</hi> 9 3. and <hi>chap.</hi> 11.7. out of which the beaſt aſcended; yet <hi>John</hi> ſaw the beaſt ariſing out of the ſea in the Viſion, noting the Popes ariſing out of the ſink of hell, by the meanes of <hi>Phocas</hi> the intruder; thus the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> is the ſea of the beaſt, or perchance that floud of the Dragon is the ſea out of which Antichriſt aroſe. Now though Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> condemned <hi>Arrius</hi>—yet through the Devils enticements they ſet up Antichriſt as chiefe Prieſt and King of Biſhops, (though for a long while the Biſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi>— were his Corrivals) Nay to that height by degrees he aroſe that he would not be preſent at any Eaſterne Council but by his Legates or Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours, leſt the Emperour being preſent he ſhould be forced to give him place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Having ſeven heads and ten hornes, &amp;c]</hi> This Beaſt is very like the Dragon, but that the Dragon wore his Crowns on his heads, this on his hornes; by hornes ſtrength is noted, who theſe horne be, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.9, 12. makes known, to wit, ten Kings, and the ſeven heads are ſeven Mountaines of <hi>Rome</hi> (for ſhe was built upon ſo many) to which chapter I defer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of this place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Blaſphemy]</hi> The Beaſt will not weare his hornes himſelf, but his ten hornes or Vaſſal-Kings ſhall; on his own head is blaſphemy, not openly written, yet plaine enough, for all his Religion and Doctrines are ſuch againſt God and Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And the beaſt which I ſaw was like unto a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard &amp;c.</hi> The word in Greek ſignifies a ſhe-Leopard, which hath a ſpeckled skin, and very odoriferous, ſwift, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile. Thus the Beaſt is ſomething like a monſter compounded of a Leopard, a Beare and Lyon. The Church of Antichriſt is ſpotted as the Leopard, being a mingle-mangle of diverſe Hereſies, Superſtitions, Idols, Traditions — conſiſting of ſeveral Orders, Sects, Clergy men; it is very odoriferous, full of the ſweet ſmels of honour, riches—it is very ſwift,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:165674:57"/>for after the world was perſwaded that <hi>Rome</hi> was the ſeat of <hi>Peter,</hi> that ſea of <hi>Rome</hi> quickly ſwallowed up all — it is craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo Antichriſt is a falſe Prophet, full of cunning deceits, gaining home much riches by this meanes. Now hee is like a Beare in the feet; her feet are flat, large — by which the ſtability and firmeneſſe of Antichriſts Kingdom is noted, this Creature hath ſharpe nailes, which it faſtens into the ground and ſo goes more firmly. Now theſe feet are the large grants of Emperours, Canons of Councils—</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His mouth as the mouth of a Lyon]</hi> Now thus Antichriſt roares in his Buls, Excommunications—and devoures very much as the Lyon; who knows not the devouring Inquiſition of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the covetous Clergy, forgiving any ſin for money?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the Dragon gave him power]</hi> All theſe things will I give thee, ſaid he to Chriſt. Now all lawfull power is from God, but the Beaſts is as his key, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. uſurped and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; the Dragons power is his malice, deceit, power to hurt (God permitting.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And his ſeat]</hi> Or throne. Satan is the Prince of this world, and the Pope his Vicegerent or Vicar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And great authority]</hi> Thus Antichriſts coming is after the working of Satan with all power and lying wonders.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And I ſaw one of his heads were wounded to death &amp;c]</hi> Here is the weakning of the beaſts power treated of (under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Beaſts head being wounded) which <hi>Brightman</hi> doth refer to the Barbarians (<hi>Goths, Vandals, Hunni,</hi> and the like) ſacking <hi>Rome;</hi> for by the ſpace of 42. yeare ſhe was by them taken and ſpoiled, no leſſe then five times, but the wound was healed by <hi>Beliſarius</hi> and <hi>Narſes</hi> (two famous Captaines) who drove the Barbarians out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the Pope with enlarged dignities and power by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperour; but in this ſenſe the wound of the Beaſt is healed even before Antichriſts riſing which was not till after, to wit, at the reigne of <hi>Phocas</hi> who exalted <hi>Boniface</hi> the third to the Chaire; this wound therefore with my <hi>Pareus</hi> I refer to the great ſchiſme of Popes, <hi>Anno</hi> 1378. wherewith the Papacy was afflicted more then 40. yeares
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:165674:57"/>when almoſt Antichriſts kingdome was ruined, (this wound the Dragon (not enduring the Beaſts pride) gave (God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting) as a puniſhment;) for two or three Popes ſtrove together for the Popedome, ſo that all was endangered; now alſo <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>John Huſſe</hi> in <hi>Bohemia</hi> began to ſtir: two witneſſes of the Goſpel, which encreaſed the deadly wound: But the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> ſtrove to be the beaſts Chirurgion, cauſing the two witneſſes to be burnt, diſplacing three Antipopes, confirming <hi>Martin</hi> 5. the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian war in behalf of the witneſſes (which opened the wound wider) is huſht up upon termes, they being allowed their conſcience in many things; now <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthons</hi> preaching like a ſword wounded; but now ſome Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand upon paine of fire and fagot men to obey the Beaſt; now many maſſacres healed the wound, and many notable Jeſuites, as <hi>Cajetan, Faber, Staphylus</hi>—applyed their skil, who by writing, boldneſſe, and craft, have been (with many others) the Popes beſt Phyſicians at all times; and our own diſſentions (ſaies my <hi>Pareus,</hi>) have been as wine and oyle pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the wound to heale it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And all the earth wondered after the Beaſt]</hi> They wondered after the Beaſt, (I meane his followers) before he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but perchance the healing might encreaſe admiration; they wondered at the ſeat of <hi>Peter,</hi> at the keyes (though falſe,) at his power (though from Satan,) and even worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Beaſt as God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The whole earth]</hi> Here obſerve
<list>
                           <item>1 The admirers are men of the earth (not Saints.)</item>
                           <item>2. The admiration is general (their Catholick Church admires after him, meaning the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh.)</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And they worſhipped the Dragon which gave power unto the Beaſt &amp;c]</hi> To wonder thus after the Beaſt is to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Dragon; for religious Worſhip and admiration (in this ſenſe) is to be appropriated only to God, <hi>thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God and him only — Deut.</hi> 6.13. Now it is to be feared (for it is certaine) theſe admirers give divine Worſhip to the Beaſt: for they ſay, <hi>Who can war with him? Who is like him?</hi> as if they had took up that of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:165674:58"/>Prophet, <hi>Who is like the Lord our God? Eſa</hi> 40.18 or as <hi>Paul, Who hath reſiſted his will? Rom.</hi> 9 19. So who can war with the Beaſt? Thus he is called Antichriſt, that is, againſt Chriſt, exalting himſelf above Kings, nay Angels, being called by ſome Jeſuites, God upon earth. Now though the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers excuſe themſelves when they worſhip Antichriſt and his Images, Crucifixes — and ſay they worſhip God — I anſwer as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20, the things which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to devils, not to God; yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve they aime at God in their ſacrifice. But enough.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And to him was given a mouth ſpeaking great things &amp;c.]</hi> By the Dragon; for he gave him this power; now by his ſpeaking great things and blaſphemies, great blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are underſtood as <hi>Antiochus</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. did <hi>ver.</hi> 20. who afflicted the Jews, as Antichriſt the Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To do]</hi> That is to rage and deſtroy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Forty and two months]</hi> Then the Beaſts power is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, God hath ſet him a time; by the 42. months the time of the Beaſts treading down the holy City or Church is ſignified, as <hi>chap.</hi> 11. then the Beaſt ſhall rage but 216. yeares more: but laſt to the end.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And he opened his mouth in blaſphemy &amp;c.]</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelf God upon earth, Chriſts Vicar, <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor higheſt Prieſt, having the keyes of heaven alone — forgiving ſins, and taking a was (as he teaches) iniquity from the world — his blaſphemies againſt God, his Tabernacle, and them that dwell therein; againſt God: for he oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf againſt all that is called God (whether they be Judges (as Magiſtrates) or Angels, for they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods) or that is worſhipped, ſhewing himſelf that he is God—ſitting in the Temple, or inſteed of a Temple, God and Oracle. Thus he arrogates to himſelf the name and worſhip of God; againſt his Tabernacle, that is, his Church, above whom he exalts himſelf as head and Lord thereof; or againſt the fleſh of Chriſt (that Tabernacle of the Deity) whom he ſaies he can create with ſome few words in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſſe; alſo he utters his blaſphemies againſt the Office of Chriſt, boaſting himſelf to be the greateſt high
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:165674:58"/>Prieſt, when Chriſt is called but the great high Prieſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And them which dwell therein]</hi> His Tabernacle is chiefly his Church againſt whom the Beaſt blaſphemes, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church and Saints on earth: but againſt the Saints and Angels in heaven; for he exalts himſelf above Angels; alſo obtrudes falſe worſhip upon the Saints and the Angels (the Inhabitants of heaven) for his own gaine ſake, ſetting them over Towns and Cities, Horſes, Hogs, as <hi>Tutelar</hi> gods, as the Heathens did.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And it was given to him to make war with the Saints]</hi> Here is another uſurpation of his power; this alſo is ſpoken of the little horne, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.20. that Type of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt to which our Goſpel-<hi>Daniel</hi> here alludes. This is the war ſpoken of <hi>chap.</hi> 11. with the two witneſſes that is many (as is ſaid) alluding to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> (who were inſtead of a thouſand) this war is to laſt but 42. months, of which already. Note the Beaſts ſwords (uſurped) are two, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar by Kings and Emperours, but Chiefly Eccleſiaſtical, by Buls, Excommunications, and hiſſing Sermons againſt the Saints, condemning them as Schiſmaticks and Hereticks. Now as here the Beaſts rage laſted 42. months, ſo the little horne warred with the Saints till the <hi>Ancient of daies</hi> came, and judgement was given the Saints, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. Now this is the laſt judgement. Note the Catholick ſtate of the Beaſts power, it was over all kindreds, tongues— theſe are the wonderers already ſpoken of <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. remember Chriſts flock is a little flock.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And all that dwell upon the earth ſhall worſhip him &amp;c.]</hi> Here is a moſt comfortable reſtriction; the worſhippers of the beaſt are not all (Chriſt hath his people) but Inhabitants of the earth, contradiſtinct to Saints, whoſe converſation is in heaven, &amp; whoſe names are there written, being elected. Now if none of the Beaſts worſhippers have their names written in heaven, there is no ſalvation for them in the ſtate they are in; God be thanked we follow not the Beaſt; this is one ſigne we are written in the Book of life, of the Lamb, becauſe we were elected to life through him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Slaine from the foundation of the world]</hi> To wit, in the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:165674:59"/>eternal purpoſe of God, and by promiſe: that the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head. Thus the efficacy of Chriſts death was to the Fathers by faith, before his actuall ſlaying, typified out by the ſacrifices.</p>
                     <p>Verſe 9. hath been oft ſpoken of.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>He that leadeth into captivity ſhall go into captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty]</hi> this may comfort the Godly; for Antichriſt (though he lead his own worſhippers to deſtruction, and domineer over the bodies of the Saints) yet he ſhall be led into captivity, by being caſt into the lake of fire, <hi>chap.</hi> 19. in the mean time they need patience to conquer withall.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And I beheld another beast coming &amp;c.]</hi> Doubtleſſe it was the ſame Beaſt, as is ſaid, but cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led another, becauſe of another forme, See <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Out of the earth]</hi> Here the original of the Beaſt is treated of, who came out of the bottomleſſe pit before; now by his coming out of the earth is meant,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That this Beaſt is not ſo terrible as the ſea monſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of; land beaſts are more familiar to us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This notes the ignoble and earthly riſe of the Beaſt; the Pope was but a poore Frier firſt, the Cardinals once but Deacons imployed about the burial of the dead of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> though now fellows for Princes; but here perchance is noted how that muckle, traſh, money—is that about which the Beaſt and his worſhippers are moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and which is the uſuall cauſe of their ariſing and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Having two hornes like a Lamb]</hi> You ſee the Beaſt ſeemes no way terrible; looks like a Lamb, like Chriſt, as if he were his Vicar, and ſervant of ſervants, yet in ſpeech he is like the Dragon. Remember the Lamb had ſeven hornes <hi>chap</hi> 5.6. this Beaſt but two, becauſe he hath not the true Lambs ſtrength, nor his meekneſſe and truth, for he ſpeaks as the Dragon; by which we are to underſtand the Beaſts falſe Doctrines, as Juſtification by works, Satisfactions — alſo his blaſphemies againſt God, the Temple, and Saints, nay, and Scripture, ſaying it is ſo far true as it is confirmed by him and his Church — therefore this Beaſt is truly called a falſe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:165674:59"/>Prophet <hi>chap.</hi> 16.13. teaching doctrines of devils.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And he exerciſeth all the power of the firſt Beaſt before him &amp;c]</hi> Doubtleſſe here Antichriſt as a deceiver — is deſcribed. Now the whole ſeries of Popes is here meant, who have uſurpedly exerciſed the power of the Beaſt already mentioned; perchance the Cardinals ariſing may be here no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who as a ſecond Beaſt exerciſe the ſame mentioned pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the former Beaſt, and that before him and by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but theſe are better comprehended under the notion of Locuſts: otherwiſe this Beaſt might have been called another, yet the like (for that begot this) and yet aroſe after the other, for theſe Cardinals were once ſcarce Pariſh Prieſts, and in time are after the Pope; however the ſeries of the Popes have made (and ſo have theſe Cardinals) the earth or the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants thereof (in the forequoted ſenſe) to worſhip the former wounded (but healed) Beaſt: that is, the Pope as a deceiver—here cauſeth himſelf to be worſhipped as a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prince: Or theſe Cardinals as a ſecond Beaſt (yet in ſome ſenſe the ſame with the former) cauſe the former Beaſt (or Pope) to be worſhipped of all the admirers and wonderers: of which already.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And doth great things, ſo that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth]</hi> Antichriſt ſhall deceive (if it were poſſible) the very Elect. Wonders and miracles have ceaſed (the Church being built) and now they belong to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, not to the Church of Chriſt. Now one of his great ſigns is:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He maketh fire to come down from heaven]</hi> Whether alluding to <hi>Elias</hi> or Satan in <hi>Job</hi> 1. it matters not;<note place="margin">2 <hi>King</hi> 1.</note> for certainly he would be accounted a man of God, though his working be after Satan. Now the Pope—does not literally do this, no more then the Diſciples removed mountaines, yet they did very great things, and were the true Diſciples, as the Pope is the Beaſt, although he literally bring not fire from heaven, ſince he does other great ſigns belonging to Antichriſt; yet the Spirit is likened to fire, and ſo deſcended and lighted upon the Apoſtle; now the Pope takes upon him to give the Spirit in conſecration and forgiveneſſe of ſins; and as Satan
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:165674:60"/>deſtroyed <hi>Jobs</hi> ſheep by fire, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. ſo this Beaſt deſtroyes Princes by thundering Excommunications.—</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the ſight of men]</hi> That is openly.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And deceiveth them that dwell upon the earth by thoſe miracles which he had power to do &amp;c]</hi> Thus Antichriſt is a ſeducer, but not of Saints, but of the Inhabitants of the earth. Thus God puniſhes them that deſire not, nor receive the truth to ſalvation; the Saints rely on Scripture, and with the <hi>Bereans</hi> examine all things, and ſo are not deceived; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles muſt not prove the faith nor truth then in this Age. Now follows the grand Idolatry of <hi>Rome;</hi> his worſhippers are commanded to make an Image (or Images, for that is the meaning of it) to the Beaſt, not of the beaſt, but of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit, <hi>Mary</hi>— ſo that the Beaſts kingdom (you ſee) is a kingdom of Images or Idols; thus the Pope commanded his Worſhippers to do.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And he had power to give life to the Image of the Beaſt]</hi> Satan gives the Pope this power; thus though the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had his power from Chriſt (as alſo <hi>Aaron</hi> had from God) yet the Pope (now a beaſt) hath his uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped power (as alſo <hi>Caiphas</hi>) from Satan, by which the one condemned (or helped to forward it) Chriſt, the other Chriſtians. But how can the Images ſpeak? Why, remember the worſhippers pray to them, ſacrifice to them, confide in them, beleeve they help them—thus the Beaſt and his Locuſts perſwade the wonderers: ſo in ſome ſenſe you ſee the Images have life — (as Bell and the Dragon had) they applying that to the Image which is in the party repreſented in ſome ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And cauſe that as many as will not worſhip the Image be ſlaine]</hi> This the Pope or Antichriſt cauſeth. <hi>Babylons</hi> Law is univerſally to be obſerved by all Romaniſts, <hi>Whoſoever will not fall down and worſhip the Image, let him—Dan</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Pope cauſed <hi>John</hi> the Emperour of the Eaſts Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to be ſlaine; and his Maſter the Emperour to be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed becauſe of this: <hi>viz.</hi> refuſing and prohibiting the Image of the Beaſt to be worſhipped.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And he cauſeth all to receive a marke in their right
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:165674:60"/>hand or in their fore-heads.]</hi> Chriſt ſealed his (as is ſaid <hi>ch.</hi> 7.) now Antichriſt imitates the marke is nothing but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and acknowledgment of the beaſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the right hand]</hi> Meaning by oath, for lifting up the hand is meant, or ſwearing to obey the Pope, and openly profeſſe his worſhip (meant by having the mark or character in their fore-head, as <hi>chap.</hi> 7. I have noted.) The laity adore the beaſt and worſhip the image, but there is a moſt ſtrict tye (of oathes and vowes) laid upon the Clergy.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And that none might buy and ſell, but he that has the character of the beaſt,</hi> &amp;c.] This is to be underſtood of a ſpirituall traffique. Now the Prieſts, Jeſuits and Biſhops (ſworne vaſſals of Antichriſt) are the only merchants to trade in the ſea of <hi>Rome.</hi> None elſe may preach, ſell the wares of Maſſes, abſolutions—for it is a mony matter. Yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth in a Bull commanded, not ſo much as any commerce to be had with any that profeſſed not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſervants to the Romiſh Church; that is, that had not the badge or mark of the beaſt.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Here is wiſedome, let him that hath underſtanding count the number of the beaſt, for 'tis the number of a man—]</hi> The character differs from the number of the beaſt; the former cheifly belongs to the Clergy by Oathes and ſpeciall Vowes, the latter is more generall to all the laity to acknowledge the Kingdom and Religion of Antichriſt; (for the character ſeems to look at the ſpirituall merchants ſpecially) the holy Ghoſt propounds it as eaſie to find out this name, being but the number of a man, or for a man to reckon; then the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out, is commended for wiſedom to ſtirre up people to reckon and ſearch to find it. Now if <hi>John</hi> received the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation in Hebrew, then the number muſt be in Hebrew, and this fits in,

                     <p>CHIRST is the Lamb who ſtands as a watchman looking to the Churches ſafety. Mount <hi>Sion</hi> is the Church which cannot be quite removed, but ſtands faſt for ever; for the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it; the Mount is high, ſo the Church is advanced many ways. The 144000. are the ſealed ones <hi>chap.</hi> 7. Now Chriſt appears after the cruell beaſt, to ſhew he had not, nor ſhould devour all; Chriſt had a Church of ſealed ones (though the woman were (as it were) quite fled.) Thus Chriſt, as in the time of <hi>Elias,</hi> has his people before <hi>Luther,</hi> on mount <hi>Sion</hi> 144000. This ſtanding on mount <hi>Sion</hi> belongs to all the time from Antichriſt, or the beaſts riſing. Thus the latter part of the Act is comfort againſt the womans flight and the beaſts ariſing.</p>

See <hi>chap.</hi> 5.9. expounded. Note that the 144000. are the remnant of the womans ſeed mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. who were to make war with the beaſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. who were not as yet received into glory (for here ſome things are ſpoken of them, as if they were yet on earth, to wit, their docibility.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Before the throne, and before the four beaſts, and the Elders:]</hi> Then obſerve this voyce was in heaven, the voyce of the Church triumphant, though diſtinct from the Elders and beaſts, they being the faithfull of the Jewiſh Church and of the Primitive Beleevers (as is obſerved already) theſe ſing before the beaſts and Elders who were in bliſſe before them. Note the hundred forty thouſand are ſaid to ſtand upon mount <hi>Sion;</hi> but when Antichriſt aroſe; or thereabout.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And no man could learn that ſong, but the one hundred forty and four thouſand which were brought from the earth.]</hi> Learning belongs to this life, not to heaven; Note the ſealed ones are docible, the adopted are taught of God; they know only the myſteries of God, or the harpers ſong. The new ſong then being the ſerving and celebrating the name of God, is to be learned by Gods children, imperfectly here, perfectly hereafter.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:165674:62"/>Note the harpers, beaſts and 24 Elders are all before the throne, therefore partakers of the ſame glory, and all follow the Lamb, becauſe redeemed from the earth, to wit, by the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood of the Lamb.</p>

                     <p>Hence obſerve (after the reſurrection) there will be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heaven; and now is, in its kinde.</p>

Now men beleeve the truth, henceforth men die in the truth, in the Lord, &amp; for the Lord; That is, for his cauſe (there is no ſalvation then to them that are not in Chriſt). Hence learn, is there ſuch torments for Antichriſt? Here then is good ground for the Saints patience a while under tryal. Are they bleſſed that depart in Chriſt? then death's not the end of all. The death of the body under tyrants, hurts not the ſoul
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:165674:63"/>of the Saints. Laſtly, it is infinitely more comfortable dying ſince the Reformation (by the three Angels —) then in the days and Church of Popery; bleſſed be God; but enough till <hi>verſ.</hi> 14.</p>

Yet perchance that verſe may be taken thus, <hi>write,</hi> to wit for the Saints comfort, and as a thing remarkable; <hi>from henceforth bleſſed are the dead,</hi> to wit, ſince Reformation by the three Angels, for now purgatory-lyes are confounded; and men are taught to be preſently happy after death, and are taught juſtifying faith which brings comfort at death; now men are taught works follow the workers to heaven, not to juſtifie, or ſave abſolutely; yet they follow, for Chriſt out of mercy and promiſes annext to good works, will reward them with glory. This white cloud ſignifies Chriſts divine Majeſty: for God becauſe of his heavenly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is often in the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> ſaid to ride on the clouds.

                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And the Temple was filled with ſmoak, &amp;c.]</hi> Not a cloud, as 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.10, 11. but ſmoak, noting how the Church (of <hi>Rome</hi>) was to be filled with darkneſſe and confuſion, and conſequently wrath of God. Which though formerly it were in the Romiſh Church (not of new) yet now it began more plainly to appear, after the light of the truth; that no man could enter into heaven above (noted by the Temple) becauſe of darkneſſe of ignorance and ſin; nor could enter into the Church to receive light (becauſe nothing but blindneſſe and darkneſſe) till the ſeven plagues were paſt, that is never: for the ſeventh Angel is the Archangel at the laſt day; thus none of the beaſts worſhippers have light, nor can enter into the Temple of heaven, in the ſtate they are in for ever. But Chriſt we hope will call many of them home, as that great City or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> decays. — Thus farre the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the fifth Viſion. The ſmoak comes from Gods glory and power: and the blindneſſe from God as a righteous judgement.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Viſion <hi>5. Verſ 1.</hi> And I heard a voice out of the Temple, ſaying to the ſeven Angels, go, &amp;c.]</head>
                  <p>FOrmerly two witneſſes <hi>chap.</hi> 11. that is a few, were rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up againſt Antichriſt. Now ſeven, that is, very many, who by their preaching —ſhall as the witneſſes cauſe Vials of wrath to be poured upon Antichriſt. We have heard of the Beaſt againſt the witneſſes <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. the Dragon againſt the woman <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. the Beaſt againſt the Saints by warre <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. —and ſuffering none to buy and ſell but his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Merchants: not followes a ſtrang change; Judgments for the Antichriſtian company.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beaſt and Merchants goe]</hi> There is Commiſſion:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pour out]</hi> not drop, aggravating the puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pour out his viall upon the earth]</hi> Leave none at all in the veſſell upon the earth, in <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. theſe Angels note mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And the firſt went and poured out his Viall upon the earth]</hi> Note the readineſſe of the Angels in obeying the Lord, whoſe voice out of the Temple or heaven commanded them even now, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. On the earth, that is, the inhabitants of the earth, or worſhippers of the beaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And there fell a grievous noyſom ſore upon the men which had the mark of the beaſt, &amp;c.]</hi> To wit, on Antichriſts mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ones. Tis an alluſion to the firſt Egyptian plague of boils and blaines, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.9. for here is oft ſuch puniſhments as haile, locuſts, blood.—</p>
                  <p>Now though God may puniſh the Roman Church with outward diſeaſes (as the French pox which follows the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Clergy —) yet ſince outward diſeaſes are common to all, chiefly with <hi>Brightman</hi>) I underſtand theſe plagues to be in men, as hatred, envy, malice againſt the true light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the preaching of the Goſpel to the inhabitants of the earth by the firſt Angel; note the Goſpel is the ſavour of life to the Saints, though it be as a Vial and torment to the marked
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:165674:67"/>ones, becauſe it hinders their riches, honour, pride, tyranny, — Now what greater ſore then a tormented, vexed mind.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And the ſecond Angel poured out his Vial upon the Sea, and it became as the blood of a dead man]</hi> So in the Viſion the ſea is the Romane Church, or gathering together of Churches; Perchance the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> whether all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gathered for help, when the firſt Vial was poured out; it laſted many years; many rivers, as Cardinals, Biſhops, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, &amp;c. run hither and made up the ſea (to conſult againſt Chriſts true witneſſes,) however, the ſea of <hi>Rome</hi> (or Church) is the ſea; the Biſhops and Doctors are the rivers and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains (which make up the ſea) or the fountains are Scripture all corrupt (at leaſt to them) this is a plain alluſion to that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian plague when the waters were blood: ſo here the Church, Biſhops, Doctors, are polluted; ſo the Scripture the fountain in ſome ſenſe of water, is polluted to them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (by a juſt judgement) but as muddy and puddle to them, being hid to them that be loſt. Hence the Angel of the waters, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. who to wit, poured out his Vial in the Viſion on the waters, praiſes God for the equity of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, giving them blood to drink (ſpiritually, for that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was puddle to them, which is pure water in it ſelf, for that the Doctors —were beſotted, given to deluſions and traditions; So that their People compared to the creatures in the ſea, do ſpiritually die, wanting the true waters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort) who ſhed the blood of the Saints really. Perchance ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly the ſea of <hi>Rome</hi> may litterally become blood, by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants oppoſing her, and when the Kings ſhall hate the whore, <hi>chap.</hi> 17, 17, 18. and burn her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. <hi>For they are worthy]</hi> Evil works are perfectly evil and deſerve puniſhment; but good works are always imperfect, (nay if never ſo good, debts to the Creator; therefore) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving no reward, but have it out of free mercy and promiſe. But enough to <hi>ver.</hi> 7. which is eaſie. The Angel from out of the Altar was mentioned; <hi>chap.</hi> 14, 18. who ſaid, thruſt in thy ſickle: and here praiſes God; to which place I referre the Reader; and for brevity ſake have done with theſe ſeven verſes.</p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:165674:67"/>
                  <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And the fourth Angel poured out his Vial upon the Sunne]</hi> In the Viſion this may be as well called the Angel of the Sun, as well as the others of fire and water: they are called ſo becauſe of their pouring out their Vials on the Sun, Water, Earth, — and becauſe God perchance by theſe ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Saints at the laſt day to himſelf, and caſteth the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into hell fire.</p>
                  <p>The Sunne notes the holy Scripture, by which our dark minds are enlightned, as the world is by the Sun: God by way of a judgement is ſaid to give the Sun to the bright Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, making it in the latter days much more clear, piercing, ſcorching the conſciences: or becauſe the Antichriſtian not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, (ſhall by a juſt judgement) have ſtrong deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>beleeve a lie, and not receive the knowledge of the truth</hi> or repent unto ſalvation, but continue in unbelief, malice, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, noted by their being ſcorched.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Vial is poured out upon the Sunne, giving more light, to the envy of the marked ones, who for madneſſe gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bit themſelves, having yet no mind nor grace ro re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</p>
                  <p>Now had the Vial been litterally poured out on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters formerly, or now on the Sun, the puniſhment had been common to all, not proper to Antichriſtians (noted by the men,) as the text intends.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And men were ſcorched, &amp;c.]</hi> to wit, the marked ones. Thus the word as a fire burns, though chiefly 'twas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for ſalvation; no wonder then there appeared before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand ſmoak in the Temple or heaven, noting the blindneſſe of Antichriſtians &amp; obſtinacy, and Gods wrath upon it, hindring their coming into heaven. Obſerve, men yet repented not; though God ſend his Word and Judgements to call to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nay though they knew God had power over the plagues, yet they returned not to him, but hardened their hearts The Popelings though they be ſcorched by this light, as by a fire, yet will not for their Riches Honour, and Ambition-ſake take notice of it to amendment of life, to give God the glory, to wit, of the juſtneſſe of the puniſhment inflicted. 2. Of the truth of the Goſpel diſcovered. 3. Or their recovery deſired.</p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:165674:68"/>
                  <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And the fifth Angel poured out his Vial upon the ſeat of the Beaſt, and his Kingdome waxed dark]</hi> Upon the preaching of the Word to Antichriſts Seat and Kingdome (for the noiſe of the truth by books and preaching hath reached thither) his Courtiers, ſubjects and ſelf-continuing obſtinate, God by a further judgement darkens them more and more, puniſhing one ſinne by another, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26. which darknes begins every day to be more manifeſt. Here is an alluſion to the litteral Egyptian darkneſſe; but this is to be ſpiritually taken, for the darkneſſe of the mind: the profoundeſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of <hi>Rome,</hi> are fools in the ſaving matters of faith by a juſt judgement of God. So that Goſpel which naturally brings light to them that ſit in darkneſſe and in the ſhadow of death, by accident brings more darkneſſe upon theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they gnawed their tongues]</hi> Noting the extream rage of Antichriſtians againſt God and truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For paine]</hi> Or grief, becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> is declining, and grown to be a kingdome of darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Blaſphemed the God of heaven]</hi> In that they condemn the Goſpel of Chriſt for hereſie, and the true Preachers for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repented not]</hi> But taught their marked ones they were in the right and light: though <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>and</hi> 9. they rage and are mad at the Sunne of light, which they cannot darken nor will acknowledge to be true; but who is more blind then thoſe that will not ſee?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> How can Miniſters inflict plagues, or poure out Vials?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They communicate in the work of God as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workers, they preach the Goſpel, upon contempt of which the Lord for them puniſheth the obſtinate and contemners, as is noted, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. about the witneſſes ſmiting the earth largely, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And the ſixth Angel poured out his Vial upon the great river</hi> Euphrates, <hi>and the water thereof was dried up, &amp;c]</hi> This Vial and the former have been pouring out a great while. <hi>Babylon</hi> had two ſtrong fences: the wals which were one of the wonders of the world, very thick and high: Then
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:165674:68"/>ſecondly the great river run thorough it (as I noted out of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> in my quoted book. <hi>pag.</hi> 109.) which was greater ſtrength to the city then the wals, being very deep. <hi>Cyrus</hi> and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers, deſpairing of the wals, make many deep ditches: and whiles the Babylonians riot and feaſt within ſecurely, ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and contemning the beſiegers: they brought the river <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> into thoſe ditches or channels, and ſo enter into <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> as it were on dry ground and took it. The myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> hath in ſtead of wals, Emperours, Kings, Princes to defend her; inwardly <hi>Rome</hi> (the myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi>) hath tythes, firſt-fruits, Peter-pence, indulgences, and the like, in ſtead of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> which the Kings of the Eaſt, (alluding to <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> Kings of the Medes and Perſians, who are Eaſt of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and cauſed the literal <hi>Euphrates</hi> to be diverted) that is, Chriſtian Kings, Princes, Miniſters, (People, for they are from Chriſt, who is the Angel of the Eaſt, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.2. <hi>and the day-ſpring from on high,</hi> Luke 1.78. <hi>who viſited us</hi>) who ſhall divert <hi>Euphrates</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> throw down her riches, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them towards the maintenance of Schools, Goſpel-teachers; theſe the Miniſters firſt preached againſt, as againſt Peter-pence, Abſolution-money and the like, and other reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues Emperours and Kings have better imployed, diverting them and their courſe from <hi>Rome</hi> (witneſſe King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth in <hi>England</hi>—) ſo in time <hi>Rome</hi> will be more feaſeable when her Riches and Honour ceaſe more and more. This the ſixth Vial means. And <hi>Anonymus</hi> two hundred and ſeventy years ago, ſaid, the preaching of the Goſpel ſhould cauſe to take away earthly dominion, and temporal poſſeſſions from the Clergy: to wit, of <hi>Rome.</hi> God be thanked no Kingdome in <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> (except <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>) but have more or leſſe diverted the <hi>Euphrates</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and made way for the Kings of the Eaſt, (Miniſters and good Chriſtians) to take her.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>I ſaw come out of the mouth of the Dragon]</hi> Since the riches and <hi>Euphrates</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is drying up, ſhe ſends Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to the Kings of the earth to help her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe come out of the mouth of the Dragon, Beaſt and falſe-Prophet]</hi> In the Viſion which is but one, as is noted. <hi>chap.</hi> 13.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:165674:69"/>the Dragon furniſheth them with lies, the monſter or ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaſt (repreſenting Antichriſt as a ſecular Monarch) with ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, the falſe Prophet or land-beaſt (who was like a Lambe in part,) with all deceit of unrighteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Three impure ſpirits]</hi> Meaning the ſpiritual fathers of <hi>Rome's</hi> Church. Three denotes Perfection or a ſufficient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as two witneſſes do <hi>chap</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Impure ſpirits]</hi> So are theſe locuſts in their original and life;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Like Frogs came out of the mouth of that Dragon, &amp;c.]</hi> In impudent loquacity and filthineſſe; what more irkſom then croaking of Frogs? So the clamours of theſe meſſengers to the Kings of the earth prating any thing to gain their aid for Antichriſt; what more impure then frogs both in their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and living? the ſame is true of the Romiſh Parats and Fryars; who may well be ſaid to come out of Antichriſts mouth, being orders of his confirming, having no ground in the Word. Now theſe are Antichriſts uſual Legates or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>For they are the ſpirits of divels]</hi> From the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon who gave Antichriſts place, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. Their craft and ſubtilty is from hell; though then they make a faire ſhow of religion, yet they are of the diſpoſition of the devil their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Working miracles]</hi> No Church ſo brags of miracles as that of <hi>Rome:</hi> but tis known Antichriſts coming is with ſignes and wonders, and with all deceivableneſſe of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Who go forth]</hi> as Ambaſſadours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the Kings of the earth]</hi> To wit, heathen and idolatrous. It ſeems towards the end, Antichriſt to keep up his falſe tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering power, will make league with Indians, or any infidels. Thus the prating frogs, (Jeſuites) lie moſt uncleanly in ditches and mire (of riches, vanity, and temporal honour) and are ſent as the Popes Nuncio's or Emiſſaries, to gaine the helpe of the Kings of the earth againſt the day of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Bleſſed is he that watcheth and keepeth his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c.]</hi> To wit, in this dangerous deceitful time, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:165674:69"/>keeps his garments, See <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. that they be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with the world and fleſh: for Chriſt comes unawares as a thief in the night. This then is a cautionary parentheſis, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the day of the Lord is at hand, againſt which we ſhould watch and be prepared.</p>
                  <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And gathered them together]</hi> To wit, the unclean ſpirits ſhall gather them, that is, the Kings of the earth, by their falſe miracles, lies and prating.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To battel]</hi> to fight againſt Antichriſts oppoſers, (truly a great miracle that men ſhould fight for the beaſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> when his other vaſſals ſhall hate him, as <hi>chap.</hi> 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 16.17.) no wonder if they come to Armageddon or a place of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and ruine, Since they fight againſt <hi>Jehovah</hi> for the beaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Called in the Hebrew tongue Harmageddon]</hi> This Word and ſuch like prove this book was delivered to <hi>John</hi> in Syriack or Hebrew.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Megiddo</hi> was the place where that moſt hopeful Prince <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> was ſlain, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.22. by <hi>Necho</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon (for twas an infinite loſſe) the ſad Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the book of Lamentations, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>Harmageddon</hi> in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew ſignifies a mountain. So <hi>Har-megiddo</hi> is but the hill of <hi>Megiddo.</hi> True, <hi>Megiddo</hi> was the city, but the hill &amp; field where the battel was fought, was after cal'd by that name. So the kings of the earth ſhall be brought to another place of confuſion, or another <hi>Megiddon.</hi> The alteration of letters are nothing, if the tongues be conſidered in which they are writ. Two things are here to be noted.

                     <hi>And the Cities and Nations fell]</hi> To wit, of Turk, Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen, American, and all earthly Kingdoms now at the great Day. Yet perchance theſe may come (helping the Whore by the mediation of the three unclean ſpirits) to ſome, nay many private overthrows or Armegeddons before the laſt day, for many Kings ſhall hate her and burn her before, as <hi>chap.</hi> 17.16. Why may not Kings of the earth to their deſtruction ſtrive
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:165674:70"/>to help her before, by a ſecret judgment?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And great</hi> Babylon <hi>came into remembrance before God,</hi> &amp;c.] God thought on her before but now at the appointed day pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the old debt fully.

                  <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And there fell great haile as of a talent weight out of heaven upon the men,]</hi> God plagued <hi>Egypt</hi> and deſtroyed the <hi>Canaanites</hi> with great haile and hailſtones, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.11. and by it is noted Gods terrible judgments againſt the wicked, and vaſſalls of Antichriſt.

                     <hi>A Talent]</hi> Being a hundred pound weight, notes the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the judgment. Now I know not but theſe things may in ſome ſort come literally to paſſe at the laſt day; when Earth Sea, or Iſlands, Aire or Haile, nay and fire, all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall conſpire againſt the curſed and wicked.</p>

But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſecond and better thoughts I finde, that the curſed raging of hell-hounds againſt God is here expreſſed after the great day; who though they ſhall at the ſight of the judge, cry <hi>moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi> — <hi>fall one us,</hi> yet deſpairing (and convicted in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the juſtice of the ſentence) ſhall never ceaſe (with their mouth's however) to pour out blaſphemies againſt God, as if he were unjuſt and unmerciful, becauſe of the haile or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall torments of hell.

The Beaſt is the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> with whoſe ſpoils ſhe is adorned. Thus as a whore ſhe is an adulterous Church, having uſurped pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as a Beaſt or Monarch ſhe hath a temporal ſword, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as is noted, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. yet but one Antichriſt.</p>

Indeed all <hi>Romes</hi> religion is myſterious, full of myſteries; openly the Pope cals himſelf Chriſts Vicar, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Chriſts Spouſe; myſtically hee's Antichriſt, and ſhe the whoriſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:165674:72"/>a chaſt Matron, the mother of the Martyrs and man-child; now of the mother of fornication and whoredoms.

                     <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>I ſaw the woman drunken with the blood of Saints]</hi> Either full of blood which ſhe had ſhed (as the book of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs can teſtifie.) See <hi>chap.</hi> 11.

                     <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>For the marriage of the Lamb is come, &amp;c.]</hi> The betrothing between Chriſt and his Church is in this world by faith and the word preached; the word wooes the Church for Chriſt, faith imperfectly embraces him, the conſummation of the marriage is at the laſt day, when Chriſt and the Church
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:165674:82"/>ſhall for ever be together, enjoying one another perfectly: there ſhe ſhall as a wife enjoy him; here only as a Virgin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troathed. —</p>
                     <p>She hath made her ſelfe ready, to wit for glory: but to her it was given to be clothed in white linnen, <hi>ver.</hi> 8 to wit, by Chriſt: by whom and with whom (as with fine linnen,) ſhe is clothed: being her ſelf naked, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It was given]</hi> Noting her natural nakedneſſe of grace and righteouſneſſe: but through Chriſts endeavours as a Bride to trim her ſelf: but is much (nay moſt) helped by Chriſt to be dreſſed (as Brides are by others) for here both dreſſings are meant: of grace, but eſpecially of glory: ſo ſhe muſt needs be a moſt glorious ſpouſe being dreſſed with Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Write]</hi> As a moſt remarkable, comfortable note: Bleſſed are they that are called (internally and effectually) to the marriage of the Lamb, begun here and perfected hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Sure <hi>eye hath not ſeen, nor eare heard, nor hath it entred into mans heart to conceive</hi> the joy, banquet, attire, and graces of this marriage and friends truly invited.</p>
                     <p>Now againſt the Papiſts (if they be bleſſed that are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) aſſurance of heaven is to be had here; for this is one of the true ſayings of God, to wit, that tis given to the Bride to be <hi>clothed in fine linnen</hi> (therefore there is no Prediſpoſition in her) and that they are bleſſed who are (in this world) invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, having heaven in part upon earth.</p>

Now <hi>John</hi> had ſeen Angels before now, and heard them ſpeak, yet never offered to worſhip till now: either being now over-joyed about the comforts of the Lamb and his ſpouſe: for which diſcourſe (for this Angel had fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly talked with him a great while) by way of thanks he would have worſhipped him: or perchance ſuppoſing he had been Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>Thus the Prediction of Chriſt is come to paſſe (in the Viſion to <hi>John</hi>) <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31.— Chriſt and his Angels coming to judge the world, hence the heaven was opened, and Chriſt in likeneſſe of a Captain, and troop of Horſe, coming thence to judge the world. Chriſt hath a white horſe, noting his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, pure, divine nature: not as if horſes or men, or ſwords were really here uſed; but under the Allegory of a General
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:165674:83"/>and an Army, the brightneſſe of Chriſts coming to judgement is ſignified, which ſome Expoſitors on this book not well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting have erred.</p>

                     <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>He was clothed in a veſture dipt in blood]</hi> Thus he came in the Prophet from the ſpiritual <hi>Bozra</hi> or <hi>Edom,</hi> to wit, hell: conquering by death all his enemies, <hi>Eſay</hi> 63.3. whoſe blood as it were ſeemed, to be upon his garments; but more on <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. of this.</p>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:165674:84"/>he is above all, and will ſuddenly manifeſt his power in their deſtruction.

                        <hi>And they lived and raigned with Chriſt a thouſand years]</hi> I ſee no difficulty in this place if well perpended; which the <hi>Millenaries</hi> wreſted to prove the Saints bodily raigning with Chriſt a thouſand years before the generall reſurrection. The ſouls never die; the ſouls of Saints, whether Profeſſours or Martyrs (from Chriſts binding Satan; and perchance here <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> with thoſe primitive Profeſſours, as <hi>Symeon, Anna, Zachariah, Magdalen</hi>—may be thought on) live gloriouſly and raigne with Chriſt in heaven.

That is, by degrees as they were converted to the faith; ſo theſe raigned with Chriſt according as in the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years they were gathered to Chriſt; as if many travellers come to their Inne, ſome at one houre, ſome at another, he that comes a five a clock, comes but that day, and ſo doth he that comes at twelve at noone; he that was received into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſome few years before Antichriſts raigning was but there in the thouſand years; ſo was he that was received into glory ſome few years before Satans looſing; Theſe then raigned in the Kingdom of grace, firſt with Chrſt, and now in glory; to wit, in ſoul, not in body, of which in order.</p>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:165674:87"/>and after death received them to raigne with him. But Satan was not ſo abſolutely bound, but that he hindred many from beleeving, or living the ſpirituall life of grace, and after of glory in the thouſand years.

                     <p>Verſ. 8.9. <hi>And he ſhall go out to deceive the Nations]</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Satan was caſt out of heaven: now though looſed, yet in a great meaſure is reſtrained from hurting the Church, but may deceive the Nations, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi> Now what is this but the looſing the four Angels or Nations bound up by the means of the great River <hi>Euphrates?</hi> (from Chriſtendom now, or the Roman Empire as formerly) See <hi>chap.</hi> 9.14 and the expoſition upon it; ſo that I need ſeek no other meaning of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog;</hi> for according as this Viſion agrees with the former: So the four Angels in <hi>Euphrates</hi> formerly were <hi>Arabians, Tartarians</hi> —and here they are underſtood by <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi> Here is an alluſion to <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38. <hi>and</hi> 39. about <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> all the open and ſecret enemies of Gods people, who after the captitive and before the <hi>Meſſias</hi> comming were to oppoſe the Jews, to wit in the latter dayes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 38.8. Meaning after the captivity (not towards the end of the world (as the Papiſts affirme) ſuppoſing this to be the army of their Antichriſt.)

                     <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And I ſaw a white throne]</hi> Here is the deſcription of the day of judgment (which I obſerved in this Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was after every Viſion after ſome ſort expreſſed except in the firſt, which being a peculiar Viſion, omits it) and after follows the joyful marriage of Chriſt and the Church, with the deſcription of the heavenly Palace or new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which Maſter <hi>Brightman</hi> miſtaking, applys it to this life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A great white throne, and one that ſate on it]</hi> Great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſet up for the general judgment of all; white, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its celeſtial ſplendor and majeſty; it is the white cloud mentioned, <hi>chap.</hi> 14.14. he that ſate on it was Chriſt, to whom God hath committed all judgment, <hi>John</hi> 5.22.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>From whoſe face the earth and heaven fled away,</hi> &amp;c.] Being

                     <p>
                        <hi>And there place was found nowhere]</hi> Moſt ſay the renovation of all things ſhall be; and that only the faſhion of the world, that is, the outward forme and corruptible qualities ſhall be deſtroyed, and ſo the earth ſhall be found no more as it was, but ſhall be made moſt beautifull and glorious, being to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the glorious Liberty (as far as 'tis capable) of the ſons of God, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. being to be freed from corruption and bondage. But few ſhew good reaſons for this renovation (except that the Saints might contemplate on the creation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; which they in heaven ſhall know to perfection, though this be altogether conſumed) now ſince all the ſons of men ſhall be in heaven or hell, to what purpoſe ſhall the renovation be? It is ſome may ſay for the Saints ſomtimes to viſite, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in and live, but their manſions are prepared in heaven; Theſe ſhall be changed (if <hi>Philoſophy</hi> could bear that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) into nothing, having ſerved the creatures for the creators pleaſure, as they were created out of nothing, or ſhall be exchanged for the heaven of heavens: Now perchance to be delivered out of corruption, is liberty enough for this whole creature (Man excepted). But we expect new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and new Earth, that is, the glorious heavenly condition of the Church above in perfect glory, and the bodies of the Saints (which are earth) conſummated: Sea ſhall be no more, <hi>c.</hi> 21.1.

For as in Paradiſe (the type of heaven) <hi>Adam</hi> was created perfect in ſtature and of a ripe choyce age: So 'tis thought, it ſhall be in heaven.

                     <p>
                        <hi>A new heaven] Eſay</hi> foretold of a new heaven and earth, <hi>chap.</hi> 65.17. which began to be accompliſhed after the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king heaven and earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.26. by a Reformation by Chriſt and the Apoſtles, when all things became new, men became new creatures: here the new heaven may ſignifie the Churches glory in heaven with Chriſt; and the earth, the bodies of the Saints moſt glorious. Maſter <hi>Brightman</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the latter to the glorious condition of the Church after the Jews Converſion, which cannot hold though we expect their Converſion (but do not beleeve it to be tyed to <hi>Judaea</hi> as he ſuppoſes,) who in ſome meaſure are daily gained to the faith. The Millenaries apply this to their golden age (of whoſe opinion in part, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> confeſſeth he once was,) but our Saviour tels us of no ſuch brave time in earth towards the end: but ſays, when the Sonne of man comes ſhall he find faith in earth? and though <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be burnt, yet both Antichriſt and <hi>Gog</hi> ſhall rage to the end. Concerning the new heaven and earth (though I almoſt ſtagger in the point) I will follow the moſt common opinion (notwithſtanding what elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where I have ſaid in this book concerning the diſſolution of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:165674:92"/>all things) and by a new heaven and new earth, (propheſied by <hi>Eſay,</hi> and in ſome ſenſe fulfilled by the renewing of the Church,) I underſtand the renewed condition of heaven and earth, literally to be fulfilled according to <hi>Eſay,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> 2.3, 13. The ſubſtance whereof ſhall not be utterly aboliſhed, but the corruptible qualities: and it ſhall be pure, bright, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. Thus the firſt heaven and earth were paſſed away, being not vaniſhed quite for ſubſtance but quality: being to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and purified by fire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A new heaven and a new earth, &amp;c.] John</hi> ſaw not the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glory of heaven (which eye hath not ſeen) but types and ſimilies of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the ſea was no more]</hi> According ro corrupt qualities, and rolling with waves, as now, but made ſolid, and in a globe, —though I know no uſe of theſe things, unleſſe to remaine as monuments of the great works of God, and of his Power, and to be renewed (as having in their nature and courſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerved their Creator,) as a reward for their ſervice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered from bondage into the liberty of the ſonnes of God (according to their capacity.) And perchance the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens may not as now compaſſe the earth or move, there being no uſe of it. But the brightneſſe and luſtre thereof ſhall be much augmented (as of the Sun and Moon.)</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And I ſaw the holy City]</hi> Here is the glory of the renewed Church ſhewed to <hi>Iohn</hi> (after he had ſeen the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed world,) and indeed this renovation of the Church, ſeems diſtinct from that of heaven and earth renewed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one cannot be well the other: or the new heaven and new earth the glorified condition of the Church: for tis ſaid <hi>And I ſaw,</hi> as diſtinct from the former. Let the Reader per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend this; alſo <hi>Iohn</hi> ſeems to inſert his name to confirm it, ſaying,</p>

                        <hi>I Iohn ſaw the Holy City, — Ieruſalem]</hi> Meaning the Church which the Scripture cals <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A City]</hi> Becauſe of its choyce and rare building; ſuch was <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> built by <hi>Salomon;</hi> more rare is this which is not built of common ſtones (but as <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.13. which I may apply in ſome ſenſe here) the Citizens are Saints: (who know one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as Citizens do.)</p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:165674:92"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>She is called holy]</hi> Becauſe glorious in heaven and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy (ſo appearing to <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Viſion;) ſhe in ſome ſort is holy here below; for Chriſt ſanctifies her, waſhing her by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, regenerates her by faith and the ſpirit. The old <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was polluted; this is new, (newly glorified in heaven in the Viſion) perfect, holy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Coming down from heaven]</hi> So <hi>chap.</hi> 3.12. noting her ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal to be from God (this muſt not be underſtood of local motion) her abode is heaven, <hi>as chap.</hi> 12. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. a woman in heaven, but here is noted her heavenly grace and majeſty, (called <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.26. <hi>Ieruſalem above</hi>) God from heaven hath choſen her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prepared as a Bride trimed for her huſband]</hi> Not preparing as in this world, in deed <hi>ch.</hi> 12. <hi>ſhe was on earth</hi> (though her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal was from heaven,) but here ſhe is actually prepared, <hi>chap</hi> 19.7. ſhe on earth had (through Chriſt) made her ſelfe ready: but now ſhe is actually adorned: So her militant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on earth is not here meant, as <hi>Brightman</hi> thought. The moſt learned <hi>Pareus</hi> obſerves, ſhe is not prepared for the Bridegroom, as before the marriage-feaſt, (for that is paſt) but for her husband, the feaſt being ended, and ſhe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. —</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And I heard a great voice out of heaven, &amp;c.]</hi> We have partly heard what <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw; now follows what he heard. Two voices he heard; The firſt comes from heaven, ſhewing joyful news to the Bride; The ſecond is his that ſate upon the Throne, <hi>ver.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Behold the Tabernacle of God is with men]</hi> Meaning that the Bridegroom and the Bride ſhall live in heaven for ever toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Gods dwelling is with men, ſince men being glorified, live in heaven. Now it had been no news to have ſaid Chriſt lives with men on earth becauſe he lived in the fleſh with them, and after by his ſpirit; but now having ended the wedding-feaſt, he and his Spouſe live gloriouſly in heaven. This the voice notes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And he will dwel with them]</hi> As in one houſe together. This is happineſſe indeed, to enjoy God the fountain of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. His abſence muſt needs be torment, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.15. The
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:165674:93"/>Saints did enjoy God; but God is ſaid there but to dwel among them, becauſe they did not perfectly enjoy him: but now he doth dwell with them as a Bridegroome with the Bride after the wedding, perfectly, by his glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And they ſhall be his People]</hi> Here is the Communion of Saints, moſt perfect in earth they were by his inchoated grace; Now they are his in part, partaking of him in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: but then they ſhall be as he is, perfectly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>And God will wipe away all tears from their eyes, &amp;c]</hi> No tears are in heaven to be wiped away, but it notes how free from all ſorrow or cauſe of ſorrow heaven is; no troubleſome thought of kindred doth poſſeſſe them there. This life is a vale of miſery. There is no death, but life; no mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning but mirth, joy, pleaſure; No cry, but peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity; No paine or labour, but eaſe, reſt, delight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For former things are paſſed away]</hi> Meaning the miſerable ſtate of this life, and a new heaven ſhall ſucceed, or a ſtate of happineſſe, read <hi>chap.</hi> 7.16. to this purpoſe expounded. This proves that this belongs not to this life, for here the Church was ever, and ſhall be (more or leſſe) afflicted.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And he that ſate upon the Throne, ſaid, &amp;c]</hi> Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, as <hi>chap.</hi> 4. or God. Chriſt cals himſelf <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> chap. 1.18. as this doth, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. whoever it were (Chriſt or God the father) he commands <hi>Iohn</hi> for the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Saints beforehand to write, how he makes all things new, becauſe the world to them is troubleſome, full of cauſes of tears and ſorrow,—therefore this was to be writ and laid up for the Churches comfort, that a moſt ſtrange ſhould happen, a new world they ſhould enjoy. Obſerve Gods love in two things here,
<list>
                           <item>1. He makes all new for the Saints ſake, (not his own, who from eternity lived with them, and could to all eternity.)</item>
                           <item>2. He for their ſakes commands this to be written (being moſt true) that they might not want conſolation.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And he ſaid unto me it is done]</hi> The thing is as true and certain as if it were done, <hi>viz.</hi> That all things ſhall
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:165674:93"/>be new, and all tears wiped away, and God would dwell for ever with men in heaven. Thus the certainty of our ſalvation is ſet forth, <hi>John</hi> 5.24. he that beleeveth is paſſed from death to life, that is, ſhall ſurely paſſe to life. It is an aſſeveration full of weight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, &amp;c]</hi> As <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I will give unto him that is athirſt]</hi> So <hi>John</hi> 7.37. and 38. Chriſt cals, which proves this to be Chriſts voyce, who ſate upon the Throne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I will give of the fountain of life freely]</hi> The water of life notes joy, comfort, refreſhment—Chriſt gives without our deſerving, freely, eternal life.

                     <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>And the building of the wall was of Iaſper] Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi> walls were choyce, yet but of Brick, Sand, Pitch; but this
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:165674:96"/>wall is of Jaſper, a precious ſtone; I ſee no more here, but the moſt happy, everlaſting life of Saints ſet forth.</p>

                        <hi>The City was pure gold]</hi> This metal we chiefly-eſteem; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Holy Ghoſt ſets forth the glorious condition of the Church or City by it; pure Gold is without droſſe, if tryed in the fire, it comes forth without any ſuch; ſhewing the moſt pure eſtate of the Church above.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Like to Chryſtall]</hi> Or clear Glaſſe, the matter is ſolid Gold, the form bright as Glaſſe or Chryſtal ſo it is as a golden City ſhining in glory; not really, but to ſtirre us up to ſeek after this heavenly <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which farre exceeds all theſe preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things to which it is (as it were) compared.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And the foundation of the wall]</hi> The matter of the wall and City is mentioned; the foundation is very preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, being of precious ſtones; ſtones are for foundations, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones; for this (being Chriſt laid by the twelve Apoſtles whoſe names were upon the foundations) the foundations were all of whole Pearles or Gemmes, which were Pillars of the wall (as it were;) thus the foundations were garniſhed with pearles or precious ſtones.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The firſt was a Iaſper]</hi> Clear and green, which the Papiſts ſay ſignifies <hi>Peter,</hi> who did ſhew a lively flouriſhing love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt indeed <hi>Peter</hi> being firſt converted, is uſually firſt named, but the ſame order of mentioning the Apoſtles by the Evangeliſts, is not obſerved alwayes, and 'tis conceived all loved him and dyed for him as well as <hi>Peter</hi> (<hi>Iohn</hi> only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted perchance, who was the beloved Diſciple &amp; writ moſt of love) therefore this of the Papiſts proves little; neither is it ſaid the Apoſtles were the foundations, but their names were written upon them; doubtleſſe the preciouſneſſe of the ſtones ſet-forth the preciouſneſſe of Chriſt the foundation, and the Goſpel preached by the the twelve; ſo the ſtones ſet forth the choyceneſſe of him that ſate upon the throne, <hi>ch.</hi> 4.3. which is a plain ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſecond a Saphire]</hi> being skie-coloured it aſwageth luſt; 'tis wonder (ſaies my <hi>Pareus</hi>) that Writers apply not this to <hi>Iohn,</hi> who only lived unmarried; the Papiſts apply it to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew;</hi> but ſince the order of reckoning the Apoſtles is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:165674:96"/>the ſame, we hence can certainly gather little. But this obſerve, if the twelve had their names upon the foundations (then had <hi>John</hi> before his death) and why may not the Beaſt like a flying Eagle reſemble <hi>John. chap.</hi> 4.7. who though alive had written his Goſpel, where he ſores aloft (like an Eagle) about Chriſts Divinity? See the expoſition on that <hi>chap.</hi> 4 7. I ſee little hindring.</p>
                     <p>

Now the foundation Chriſt, and the Doctrine of the twelve Apoſtles, both teach love as in the firſt ſtone, chaſtity in the ſecond, and expel all baſe fear as in the third ſtone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The fourth an Emerauld]</hi> A moſt pleaſant green colour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing the ſight, good againſt poyſon and the falling ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Now the foundation Chriſt is moſt pleaſing and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The fifth a Sardonix]</hi> Reſembling in part a mans nayle and the colour, 'tis good againſt pride; ſo is the foundation Chriſt and the twelve Apoſtles doctrine.</p>

                        <hi>The ſeventh a Chryſolite, &amp;c.]</hi> Being good againſt ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of breath, the Papiſts apply them to the Apoſtles; but for brevity ſake I omit them; Chriſt compleatly comprehends whats in them to perfection, who is the true foundation of the heavenly <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> the Apoſtles have their names writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon the foundation, becauſe they confirmed the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Chriſt with their blood.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>And the twelve Gates were twelve Pearles, &amp;c.]</hi> Chriſt is the only Gate, he is the way, door and life, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the miniſtry of the twelve Apoſtles we come to Chriſt, hence the City is ſaid to have twelve Gates; now the Doctrine of the Apoſtles leading to Chriſt, is more precious then Gold or Pearles, who in heaven ſhall ſhine (with the brightneſſe of Chriſt) like glorious Pearles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the ſtreet of the City was pure Gold]</hi> Now followes the inward beauty of the City; there are many ſtreets in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a Market-place or place of meeting, I ſee nothing elſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:165674:97"/>here: but the whole courſe of the Saints in heaven is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt and pure, their walking or motion and meetings (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by ſtreets) are righteous and pure as Gold; our meetings below are full of corruption, and the pureſt Church and members ſinful, therefore the ſtate of this life is not here meant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tranſparent Glaſſe]</hi> Is the Cities unutterable brightneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>And I ſaw no Temple in the ſame] Solomons</hi> gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering Temple was a type of Chriſts ſpiritual Church; heaven ſhall need none; preaching and all outward exerciſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhall ceaſe; in this world our weakneſſe needs theſe helps, then God will not be ſerved with external worſhip; Chriſt ſhall give up his miniſterial Kingdom (by which he now governs the Church) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. and God according to the Eſſence in three perſons, ſhall be all in all; each one then ſhall be taught of God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.34. <hi>None need ſay, know the Lord;</hi> all imperfection ſhall be laid aſide, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10. and tongues (which were only to build up the Church) faith and hope which were to lay hold on Chriſt, which now in the Viſion they enjoy, only charity remains.

                        <hi>For the Lord Almighty—is the Temple of it]</hi> Here the Saints praiſe him in Temples, there they ſhall immediatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in him, and keep a perpetual Sabbath to him, ſerving him day and night before the throne—ſo they ſhall rejoyce in God as in a Temple, God in heaven is inſteed of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.19, the Temple of God was open in heaven, meaning the triumphant Church who were Gods Temple in earth, now he is the Saints Temple in heaven.</p>

O glorious City! But obſerve, that <hi>Eſay</hi> is partly to be underſtood of the great light of knowledge and grace under Chriſts ſpiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (in reſpect of the dark clouds of the Law) where the Sun of light is prophecyed never to ſet fully till the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, <hi>ch.</hi> 60.20. but not onely of this ſpiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; nay, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. ſpeaks as the place now in hand, as if there ſhould be no uſe of Sun nor Moon hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>And the nations that were ſaved, ſhall walk in the light of it]</hi> Thus much for the building and glory, now of the Citizens ſomewhat. They ſhall enjoy the glorious preſence of God, who is the light of the city. <hi>Iohn</hi> having ſpoken of the city could not conveniently but mention citizens, who are indeed the very city or part of it; the Patriarchs, Prophets and Jewiſh nation (or the elect of them) are the reſt. But this muſt be taken according to the order of the viſion; and city firſt, and then inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And Kings of the earth do bring their glory thither]</hi> Not the Kings of the earth, who ſtand for the Beaſt, of which often. But Kings converted in the time of the Goſpel, of which ſee <hi>Eſay</hi> 60. at large. To which paſſage here is an alluſion, though it were in the time of the ſpiritual Kingdome of Chriſt, partly fulfilled: now theſe Kings brought their power and honour to Chriſts ſpiritual Kingdome, when they were converted, and upheld the ſame, and they bring their honour to the city a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, when their abode is forever above, being conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in glory, praiſing, honouring, &amp; lauding God and Chriſt for their ſalvation for ever and ever.</p>
                     <p>So theſe Kings are not ſuch as bring now again their earthly honour to the Church militant, for they are ſaved (as well as the nations,) not to be ſaved, implying their being in joy and ſafety.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Kings of the earth]</hi> Some of the ten converted ones: who (when in heaven) are not Kings but fellow-citizens, <hi>Ver.</hi> 26. is much the ſame.</p>

This is an alluſion to <hi>Eſay</hi> 60. thy gates ſhall be open continually, (ſpeaking of the Church militant under the Goſpel) to admit members, to wit, into the Church, Gentiles and Kings, and never ſhut as excluding none: and here tis applyed to ſignifie the ſecurity and happineſſe of the Church triumphant.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>There ſhall in no wiſe enter in any thing that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed]</hi> See <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Expoſ.</hi> on it. <hi>Paul</hi> long ſince 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. foretold as much.

                     <p>The pure river alludes to <hi>Ezek</hi> 47. or rather to Paradiſe watered by the river, that came out of <hi>Eden, Gen.</hi> 2.10. but that river drew corruption, this is pure, and water of life, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no mixture of filth, that came out of <hi>Eden,</hi> this out of the Throne. What more pleaſant then a water? behold not a fountain, but a great river, not rounding the wals of the city, but running through the ſtreets.</p>
                     <p>Let us entertain no earthly thought, for God by this ſhews
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:165674:98"/>us glorious things, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. waters iſſuing out of the houſe of God or Temple, is the doctrine of the Goſpel flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Chriſt. But in this place, as alſo <hi>chap.</hi> 7. laſt, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fountains of water are to note the fulneſſe of knowledge of God, which the faithful ſhall have by the immediate Viſion of God and the Lamb; as alſo unſpeakable purity and joy. Now the comforts of the Goſpel in this life, and its doctrine, is compared to water, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.37. Others ſay, the river is the Holy Ghoſt, proceeding from the Throne or God, conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refreſhing the city of God.</p>
                     <p>Verſ 2. <hi>And in the midſt of the ſtreet of it, and of either ſide]</hi> Here follow the abundance of all things neceſſary for the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.</p>

                        <hi>Was there a tree of life]</hi> Conferring and preſerving life, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to the tree in Paradiſe, but that was not to be touched, and this is common for all the Citizens: There was but one, (the which that in Paradiſe typed) See <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7. where I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it to be Chriſt, who is the bread of life. Now the tree (though but one) with its boughs and roots, reached both ſides the river, (though the river was very broad) noting how ſufficient Chriſt is for all the Citizens, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.7. (to which here as an alluſion) ſpeaks of many trees, yet 'twas but the ſame Chriſt conveyed many ways to the Saints, therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many trees (as the foundations were ſaid to be twelve) but here is but one Chriſt whom all enjoy alike.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of the river, &amp;c.]</hi> The tree is in the midſt of the ſtreet, becauſe barred from none; by the River, becauſe always fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, never decaying.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bearing twelve manner of fruits]</hi> I dare not ſay, here is meant the Apoſtles doctrine, who though they preached one Chriſt, yet drew comforts from him ſeveral ways. Nor will I mention the twelve articles of the faith, all comforting; But the tree notes Chriſt, who monthly, that is, continually, is bringing forth the fruits of joy and comfort to refreſh the city of God; the earneſt whereof the Saints have in this world ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways. So Chriſt in heaven (alluding to the twelve moneths of an year) brings forth twelve (nay thouſands of) fruits of joy and comfort.—</p>

                        <hi>The leaves were for the healing the Nations]</hi> Alluding to <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. So that nothing of Chriſt but is moſt ſweet and good (not as if there were need of any Phyſick in heaven, but to keep the Allegory of the tree;) ordinary trees looſe their leaves: Nothing of CHRIST but is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>

By <hi>curſe</hi> we may underſtand, not only that of the law (which is nulled) but the Anathema's of Antichriſt; alſo ſin, ſorrow, torment, death which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. Here may be intimated the curſe of delivering over to Satan in this life, becauſe of ſin in the Church; but there above is purity, and therefore no curſe, as <hi>Beza</hi> has it. There ſhall be no curſe, becauſe the throne of God ſhall be there, and conſequently bliſſe: There ſhall be no curſe, becauſe his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants there obey and ſerve him (deſerving no curſe; but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining honour unutterable) ſuch are Angels and Saints. Since the Queen of the South wondred to ſee <hi>Solomons</hi> attendants, ſure in heaven is matter of admiration.</p>

                     <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And there ſhall be no night,</hi> &amp;c.] Darkneſſe is but ſad, therefore no night of darkneſſe or ſorrow ſhall be there. The glory of God there hinders all night or darkneſſe; ſo there needs no Sun, being there is no night, ſee <hi>chap.</hi> 21.23. where this <hi>verſe</hi> is fuller explained.</p>

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:165674:100"/>repreſented by the Angel; Chriſt is the Lord of the Prophets, who confirmes the words of the Angel, ſaying, the things muſt ſhortly be done; for he comes quickly. Time runs away apace and deceives men who live in ſecurity and carelſeneſſe; Chriſt will come before ſuch are aware to judgment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bleſſed is he that keepeth theſe ſayings,</hi> &amp;c.] See <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 3. expounded.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And I</hi> John <hi>ſaw theſe things,</hi> &amp;c.] Viſionally, and heard them, therefore a good witneſſe. This is the very ſtile of <hi>John</hi> in his Goſpel; he that ſaw it bears record, and his record is true. <hi>chap.</hi> 19.35.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And when I had heard and ſeen, I fell down to worſhip before the Angel]</hi> He ingeniouſly confeſſeth his errour again. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance he committed his errour twiſe; If ſo (as it is probable, for 'twas upon the joyfull news of the Bride and her marriage that <hi>John</hi> was formerly taken in the errour about worſhipping the Angel, (<hi>chap.</hi> 19.10. See the expoſition) which now in the Viſion was paſt) it ſhews the pronenes of the beſt men to ſin more then once after reproof (as <hi>John</hi> had, <hi>chap.</hi> 19.10.) without Gods ſpeciall aſſiſting hand; alſo it notes our natures being prone to Idolatry, no wonder the world ever has been ſo prone to that ſin in all ages.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>See thou do it not —worſhip God]</hi> As <hi>chap.</hi> 19.10. The words here differ from them in <hi>chap.</hi> 19. which proves 'twas not the former errour, but a ſecond, upon <hi>Johns</hi> taking leave of the Angel. Now <hi>Iohn</hi> worſhipped not, but compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf to worſhip by falling down: So the very geſtures of Papiſts before Idols is ſinfull and forbidden, let them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip whomſoever under the Idol or Image. The Papiſts ſay the Angel out of modeſty commanded <hi>Iohn</hi> to forbear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alſo in Chriſts ſight; but the Angels reproving <hi>Iohn,</hi> proves the contrary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of them who keep the ſayings of this book]</hi> The Angel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes that it was not lawfull for <hi>Iohn</hi> to worſhip his fellow-ſervant (for ſuch are the Angels to Saints) but God only. Now the Angels fellow-ſervants are thoſe who hate the Whore and Beaſt—and flye out of <hi>Babylon</hi> —keeping the ſayings
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:165674:100"/>of the Book, worſhipping neither the Beaſt nor his Images (of which his Kingdom is full) ſo the Angels reaſons againſt <hi>Iohns</hi> worſhipping are ſeaſonable. All worſhip is due to <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> alone.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And hee ſaid to me, ſeal not the ſayings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,</hi> &amp;c.] This the Angel ſaith; but <hi>chap.</hi> 10.4. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the things uttered by the ſeven thunders to be ſealed, which ſeemes to be taken out of <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.26. where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is commanded to ſhut up the Viſion (or ſeal it) becauſe it was not to be accompliſhed for many dayes; The Angel commands this not to be kept ſecret or ſealed, becauſe all might read it, and beware of the Beaſt; alſo becauſe the time was at hand when <hi>Iohn</hi> writ (and Antichriſt has been now long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed;) God commanded the things uttered by the ſeven thunders to be concealed (not abſolutely, but in reſpect of the event) becauſe Antichriſt would not take notice of them, and therefore they were as good be kept ſecret, ſee <hi>chap.</hi> 10.4. expounded. And indeed it is worth noting, Chriſts Angel ſayes, ſeal not, but let Scripture be read; but Chriſts preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Vicar ſayes, ſeal all Scripture, let none be read (but by the Clergy) oppoſing Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 11, <hi>He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill,</hi> &amp;c.] Here is a kind of tacit Objection anſwered; for ſome may ſay, the Prophecy being open and to be read, Tyrants and Antichriſts will (through Satans inſtigation) rage the more, knowing their time is ſhort; or knowing the ſhort time comprehends hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years, they may ſay as the wicked ſervant, our maſter deferres his coming, and will rage the more in the mean time. Therefore 'twere better the Prophecy were concealed. To which is anſwered, <hi>he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill</hi>— in hope to ſcape unpuniſhed —which words are not a permiſſion or approving of filthineſſe; but a threatning a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret judgment; for reprobates ſhall be given up to a reprobate ſenſe; if after admoniſhing —<hi>ſuch will be filthy, let them be filthy ſtill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He that is righteous, will be righteous ſtill,]</hi> As <hi>Dan,</hi> 12.10. many ſhall be pure: but the wicked ſhall do wickedly; to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:165674:101"/>which our Goſpel <hi>Daniel</hi> here alludes. All the righteous will believe, and do righteouſly (though the day of judgement be not very near;) the Word in them is the incorruptible ſeed; now for their ſakes the Prophecy is chiefly, therefore ſeale it not. Here obſerve how the ſame word cauſes divers effects accidentally, <hi>tis the ſavour of life to the Elect, to the reſt the ſavour of death,</hi> as our Apoſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15, 16. bravely.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Righteous ſtill]</hi> Continuing in righteouſneſſe, and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in righteouſneſſe. Here the Papiſts ſay, ſecond Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by works is proved; for they who were juſtified firſt by Chriſt, may be more juſtified by works, as charity —but tis falſe; no works juſtifie; and Scripture which commands charity, never ſpeaks of its juſtifying. Chriſt juſtifies alone, but our good works declare us to be in Chriſt, and juſtified. So <hi>James</hi> may be underſtood, <hi>ch.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 24.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> How is a man that is juſtified, juſtified ſtill or more? (for the words in Greek bare that interpretation.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> We are juſtified but once, but ſanctified oft more and more (both which Sanctification and Juſtification are here expreſſed) but though we are but once juſtified, (as was <hi>David,</hi>) yet after ſinning and falling from God, when by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance we return to the God of our Iuſtification, we have the benefit of Juſtification renewed, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.7. <hi>David</hi> had; as that moſt pathetique Pſalme proves every where; but enough.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me]</hi> This is Chriſts voice, perchance repreſented by the Angel, yet it might be Chriſt diſtinct from the Angel; for tis no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual thing in this book as in ſome Comedy or Tragedy, to have ſeveral Perſons brought in ſpeaking of Chriſts coming quickly. See <hi>ver.</hi> 7, <hi>and ch.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My reward]</hi> Becauſe Chriſt freely gives it. Now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is eternal life, and that is the gift of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>ver. laſt.</hi> Damnation is properly a reward, ſo is not eternal life, but improperly, being out of free grace and promiſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To render to every one according to his works]</hi> The good
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:165674:101"/>mans reward (out of mercy and promiſe) ſhall be good; the wicked mans ſhall be evil (to him, but juſt as from God) out of deſert. The wicked man is rewarded for his works, being perfectly evil: the good man according to his works, which are due debts to the Creator, but imperfectly good, to which God hath annexed a promiſe out of free love, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the firſt and the laſt, &amp;c]</hi> This proves it to be Chriſts voice, who <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. cals himſelf ſo. Now <hi>Alpha</hi> is the firſt letter, and <hi>Omega</hi> the laſt among the Greeks. So Chriſt is firſt, even eternal with his father, and laſt, as God to eternity. See <hi>chap.</hi> 1.8. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. Chriſt though the Son, is as ſoon as the Father, as light and heat are in the Sunne, and fire, (yet the Sunne and fire are cauſes of them;) he that pleaſes may read the learned refutation of <hi>Engedinus</hi> the heretick againſt Chriſt being <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> by my <hi>Pareus</hi> upon this verſe.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandements]</hi> It ſeems as if ſpoken by an Angel of Chriſt, whoſe command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are mentioned: but it may be referred to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the book, or ſayings of the Prophecy, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. and then tis Chriſts voyce. Now the ſayings of Chriſt or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, are touching the not worſhipping the Beaſt, nor his image, as <hi>chap.</hi> 13. flying out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> chap. 18. and forſaking any thing of <hi>Rome;</hi> if they be bleſſed that keep them, what becomes of them that break them, worſhipping the Beaſt? The Lord remember all his People, and them in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to call them from Popery to ſalvation through Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That they may have right to the tree of life]</hi> To wit, Chriſt. Now that we have, in being his ſpiritual members and ſpouſe, who have right to their head and husband: The ſervants of the Beaſt have no right to Chriſt, being neither elected nor redeemed in general.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>For without are dogs and ſorcerers]</hi> Out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to wit, being not written in the Lambs book, <hi>chap.</hi> 21, 27. Now though all wicked men and reprobates are here meant:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:165674:102"/>yet in a moſt peculiar manner the ſervants of the Beaſt: By which you perceive how God hates all <hi>Idolaters and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dogs]</hi> Are unclean, and tearers or devourers. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Give not that which is holy unto dogs. Julian</hi> the Apoſtate was ſuch a dog, who receiving ſome knowledge of Chriſt, tore the Goſpel, and rent it with arguments out of its ſelfe, but wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now who are greater tearers of the Scripture then Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts wreſting it to deſtruction? who greater lyars againſt Chriſt and truth? who teach more falſe doctrines then they?</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 16. I <hi>Ieſus have ſent my Angel to teſtifie unto you theſe things, &amp;c]</hi> He is the Perſon ſpeaking, the Author of the Revelation, the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Lord of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Commander of the Angels, the doner of eternal life, and therefore God Omnipotent. Note, Chriſt gives himſelf that name, which long before was given him by the Angel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.20, 21. This name we ſhould chiefly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him by, this is the only name of comfort; ſo he ſays thus muth; <hi>I Jeſus,</hi> or your Saviour, <hi>have ſent my Angel,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us in mind of his love and mercies towards us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To you]</hi> Of or in the ſeven Churches, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.11. But theſe things concern all the People and Churches of Chriſt; though particularly the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> long ſince ruined. Firſt, this is comfort to us, that our Jeſus is the Angels Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, therefore we ſhall not want their aſſiſtance. Secondly that we ſhould carefully read what Chriſt commanded his Angel to teſtifie, and <hi>John</hi> to write. How ill did they who queſtion the authority of this book?</p>
                     <p>I <hi>am the root and off-ſpring of David]</hi> The root beareth the tree: ſo Chriſt as God upheld and ſaved <hi>David,</hi> but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh he was the off-ſpring or ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> and by conſequent the true Meſſias.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The bright and morning ſtarre]</hi> The meaning is, that as <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> outſhines all the ſtars: ſo Chriſts glory excels all the glory of Saints and Angels; thus Chriſt reſembles his glory to the heavenly brightneſſe and luſtre of the morning ſtarre. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:165674:102"/>Numb.</hi> 24.17. and <hi>Peter</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>v.</hi> 19. cals Chriſt a ſtar. Chriſt expels the darknes of ſin and ignorance, and brings the light of knowledge and grace: and at the morning of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection will drive away the darkneſſe of this life, and ſhew himſelf moſt gloriouſly to all the Saints.</p>
                     <p>Thus Chriſt promiſed himſelf to the overcommers, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.28. as is expounded, he being the morning ſtarre.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And the Spirit and the Bride, ſay come]</hi> That is, the Spirit in every Saint, ſayes come. Every Saint having the Spirit, longs after Chriſt; ſo <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 42.2. <hi>As the heart pants after the water brookes,</hi> (that hot, and therefore dry or thirſty creature) <hi>ſo doth my ſoule after thee O God?</hi> And the Bride or Church longs after Chriſt to be fully gloryfied by him, and to live ever with her husband; the Church Militant, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> laſt, cals for Chriſt, ſaying, be like the Roe (that nimble creature) and come in haſte; The coming of Chriſt is fearfull to the wicked, but the regenerate long for him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let him that heareth ſay, come]</hi> As the Bride doth. Truly the reading and hearing this book will make every ſpiritual man ſay, <hi>come Lord Jeſus;</hi> ſuch ſweetneſſe is here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let him that is a thirſt come]</hi> That is the qualification re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the commers; come to me for redemption, ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, glory; if athirſt, for a thirſty man is fit to drink of the fountain of water of life. Now he that is athirſt, is he that has the Spirit crying to Chriſt to come, to perfect him and the Church in glory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And whoſoever will]</hi> Being qualified and a thirſt; none elſe can come, theſe the father draweth.—</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let him take the water of life freely.]</hi> Being a thirſt, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by the Father. The invitation is generall, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. Hoe all —but note the qualification, that thirſt, come ye to the waters —but note, God worketh in us to will and do, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. whoſoever commeth then, God draweth.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>For I teſtifie]</hi> This depends upon <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. bleſſed are they that keep the words of this Prophecy; now he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens thoſe who any way corrupt or abuſe it. Sure Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:165674:103"/>falſifyers of the truth are here meant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For I alſo teſtify or teſtifie together ſayes the Greek]</hi> Becauſe the Angel had ſpoken, now Chriſt confirmes the Angels teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, witneſſing alſo with the Angel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto every man that heareth]</hi> Not the Pope excepted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If any man ſhall adde]</hi> By falſe interpretations (as 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.16.) adulterating the Text. Let the Papiſts take heed how they mingle traditions and lyes with the Text.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto him God ſhall adde the plagues]</hi> To wit, not only the ſeven laſt plagues; but to be caſt into the lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone for ever with the dragon and falſe Prophet, <hi>chap.</hi> 19 20. O <hi>Arrius</hi> and <hi>Engedinus</hi>—where are ye? O Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Hereticks, take heed.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 19 <hi>If any man ſhall take away from the words of this Prophecy, God ſhall take away his part out of the Book of life,</hi> &amp;c.] To the adders he will adde plagues; to the takers away he ſayes, hee'll take away his part out of the book of life; That is, what part he ſeemes to have; or will utterly condemne him one day. Indeed they may be ſaid to take away from the Book that deprave it, allow not of it, ſleight it or the like. The overcommers were promiſed choyce rewards in the ſeven Churches; theſe deprayers ſhall have no ſhare with them, nor with the glorious Bride in heaven. Some have denyed Saint <hi>James</hi> his Epiſtle, ſome this book through miſtake not malice (being otherwiſe true Chriſtians) and are not to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended here. <hi>Luther</hi> doubted of <hi>James,</hi> many ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians (through weakneſſe) of the authority of this moſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine book; on whom I dare not doubt but God had mercy. But note, not only the integrity, but perfection of Scripture is hence proved; ſince nothing is to be added, away then with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; the written word is perfect and only to be followed to ſalvation. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Moſes</hi> gives the ſame command, let no man adde — by which it is plain, the holy Scriptures of the Old-Teſtament were full enough and perfect to ſalvation Now our Saviour (not <hi>John</hi>) takes this paſſage from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and other things in this book are taken from the Prophets everywhere; To note the perfect agreement of the New-Teſtament and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:165674:103"/>Old, and alſo to ſhew how this Book (ſayes my <hi>Pareus</hi>) is a ſumme of holy Scripture: Well, we muſt not depend upon Revelations, but the written Word. By this Chriſt proved himſelf and his death to his diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.27. ſee my <hi>Glimps of Chriſts Love,</hi> pag. 57.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>He that teſtifieth theſe things, ſaith, ſurely I come quickly,</hi> &amp;c.] They be the words of Chriſt, not of <hi>Iohn;</hi> who teſtified and revealed this Prophecy to <hi>Iohn,</hi> being the true and faithfull Witneſſe, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.14. who promiſes to come quickly, to confute thoſe who make a mock of his coming to judgment, 2 <hi>Pet,</hi> 3.2, 3, 4. and to ſtirre us to patience and watchfulneſſe. And truly if when <hi>Iohn</hi> writ this book, Chriſt promiſed to haſte, then now he is even at the door; many Jews are daily converted, the Goſpel much ſpread, Antichriſt manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and ſpiritually killed by the Witneſſes, forſaken by the Kings of the earth (or many of them) nay and Chriſt has powerfully reigned by the Reformation of many Kingdomes in matters of Religion; We expect to hear of <hi>Romes</hi> literall deſolation; but the utter ruine of Turke and Pope we expect not till the ſeventh Viall be poured out into the aire, or the ſeventh Angel ſound at the laſt day; other things are moſt fulfilled, and we hope God for the Elect ſake will haſten his coming.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Surely I come]</hi> 'Tis an aſſeveration confirming his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed coming to comfort the godly, and to ſtir them up to watchfulneſſe and patience in well doing and ill ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>Even ſo come Lord Jeſus]</hi> Sayes <hi>Iohn</hi> after all the moſt joyfull glorious things in the Prophecy (the Beaſt and Dragon in the Viſion caſt into the lake of hell) longing for the conſummation of glory. Indeed Chriſt is the good <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maaz,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.27. that brings true and good tydings here in this life, but cheifly hereafter; of perfect redemption (which all the creation groanes for) and perfect glory for the Elect. Or <hi>Iohn</hi> may be underſtood to deſire Chriſt to haſten Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts deſtruction, to haſten comforts to <hi>Syon;</hi> and laſtly to come to judgment to condemne the Dragon and Beaſt, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:165674:104"/>deliver the Saints, redeeming their bodies out of their graves, conſummating them in glory. Thus the Spirit in all the Saints teaches to long after Chriſt, and ſay <hi>come Lord Jeſus, come quickly,</hi> even ſo <hi>Amen.</hi>
